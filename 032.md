# Deposit fee is miscalculated

## Summary

The deposit fee is not calculated correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to documentation, a fee is stored in the following format:

```solidity
uint16 of the fee value, multiply your % value by 10, Example: if you want fee of 0.5% , insert 5
```

However, in the `_deposit` function of `Carousel.sol`, the `feeAmount` is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
```

A 0.5% fee on an amount of `10_000` should be `50`, but the above calculation returns `5`.

## Impact

This results in a lower deposit fee than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the fee calculation in the `_deposit` function to the following:

```diff
-   uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
+   uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 1000);
```
