# User's fund get stuck permanently when `epochFee`( also known as `withdrawFee`) is set more than 100%.

## Summary
Users are able to withdraw their fund (including premium) only if `epochResolved`. Epoch is resolved by one of three trigger known as   `triggerEndEpoch` or `triggerDepeg` or `triggerNullEpoch`.   If `epochFee` is set more than 100% (more than 1000 points) then `triggerEndEpoch` and `triggerDepeg` will fail due to subtraction underflow error.

## Vulnerability Detail
If `epochFee` is more than 100%, fee amount calculated is higher than TVL and lead to subtraction underflow.  Below are some code which clearly shows this is going to fail if fee is greater than 100%. 

```solidity
      uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);
        uint256 collateralFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(
            collateralTVL,
            epochFee
        );
        premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, collateralTVL - collateralFee);
        collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, premiumTVL - premiumFee);
```

```solidity
     uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);
     uint256 premiumTVLAfterFee = premiumTVL - premiumFee;
```
Once epoch fee is set during epoch creation, even owner/admin can not change the fee of that specific epoch. Which leads use's fund get stuck in vault.  

## Impact
User's fund permanently stuck in vault because trigger methods fails due to subtraction underflow when `epochFee` is greater than 100%.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add validation that `epochFee` aka `withdrawFee` is never set greater than 100%
