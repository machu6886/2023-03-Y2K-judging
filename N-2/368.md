# Users cannot use redundant emission shares

## Summary
When the `burn()` function is called, the protocol only reduce the shares of vault, it iwll lead to  inconsistent data between the  shares of vault and  emission  shares.

## Vulnerability Detail
We can notice that the shares of vault and  emission shares are matched when mint ,`safeTransferFrom` and `_burn()`.However, if user call the function `NFT.burn()`,the protocol only reduce the shares of vault. It leads to inconsistent data between the two, confusing bookkeeping, and the emission shares will always be there.


## Impact
Confusing protocol bookkeeping,user will be not able to use  emission shares.
