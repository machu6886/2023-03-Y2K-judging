# [Carousel] Users lose money in mintRollovers because wrong calculation of assetsToMint

## Summary
When a user deposits to an epoch, they receive the same amount of share tokens, meaning that each share is worth one deposited token. 
However, **after winning the epoch, the value of the shares increases.**

### BUT
In the `mintRollovers` mechanism, the value of the shares is not taken into account and the user exchanges 100 shares of their old epoch for 100 shares of the new epoch, which have lesser value.
`_mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint)`

`mintRollovers ` must consider entitledShares for minting new shares (like `withdraw `function)

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider these steps:
_for simplicity suppose that `relayerFee=0`_
1. user deposits 100 USDC to epoch A
2. user gets 100 tokens of epochA
3. user wins the epoch and can get 1000 USDC if withdraw his shares
4. user enlists in rollover with 100 epochA tokens
5. user calls mintRollovers for epoch B
  a. 100 epochA tokens are burnt: 
    `_burn(
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        queue[index].epochId,
                        queue[index].assets
                    );` 
  b. 100 epochB tokens are minted:
          `uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;`
         `_mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint);`
6. 100 epochB tokens worth 100 USDC and the user has lost 900 USDC. 
  _(user could withdraw 1000USDC from epochA and deposit them to epochB and get 1000 shares of epochB)_

## Impact
user loses money because of wrong calculations in mintRollovers function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use entitled shares to calculate mint amount (like withdraw function):

```solidity
uint256 assetsToMint = entitledShares - relayerFee;
```
instead of this line:
```solidity
uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;
```
