# Insurance Seller Might Lose Collateral Due To Wrong Epoch Settings

## Summary
Wrong Epoch settings can cause Depositors in risk vault (insurance sellers) to lose their collateral funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the VaultFactoryV2.sol contract, createEpoch() can only be called by the owner. And the owner can input an _epochBegin time that is greater than the _epochEnd time, as their is no check for this error it can lead to loss of collateral funds to insurance sellers. Say the owner sets an _epochBegin time greater than the _epochEnd time at a specific strike price, if the spike price was never going to be hit before the _epochEnd it will hit and a depeg event will happen leading to insurance sellers having their collaterals liquidated as after an epoch has started it never ends.
## Impact
Possible loss of Collateral funds deposited by insurance sellers.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L137-L169
```solidity
    function createEpoch(
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint40 _epochBegin,
        uint40 _epochEnd,
        uint16 _withdrawalFee
    ) public onlyOwner returns (uint256 epochId, address[2] memory vaults) {
        vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketId];

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0)) {
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);
        }

        if (_withdrawalFee == 0) revert FeeCannotBe0();

        if (!controllers[IVaultV2(vaults[0]).controller()])
            revert ControllerNotSet();
        if (!controllers[IVaultV2(vaults[1]).controller()])
            revert ControllerNotSet();

        epochId = getEpochId(_marketId, _epochBegin, _epochEnd);

        _setEpoch(
            EpochConfiguration(
                _epochBegin,
                _epochEnd,
                _withdrawalFee,
                _marketId,
                epochId,
                IVaultV2(vaults[0]),
                IVaultV2(vaults[1])
            )
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check to make sure the beginning of an epoch is not greater than the end of the epoch during creation. For example:
```solidity
if (_epochBegin >= _epochEnd) revert EpochEndMustBeAfterBegin();
```
