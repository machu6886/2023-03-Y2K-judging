# Possible subtraction overflow in mintRollovers

## Summary
`mintRollovers()` keeps accounting of indexes it has processed from `rolloverQueue` in rolloverAccounting[_epochId]. And later when this function is called logic doesn't check the relationship between `index` and `length` and this is important as length of `rolloverQueue` can decrease due to a call from `delistInRollover`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to delist feature length can be shortened and this will lead to `index` being higher than `rolloverQueue.length` and can cause underflow error. Due to an underflow error `mintRollovers()` will not work.
```solidity
    	uint256 length = rolloverQueue.length;
    	uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];

    	// revert if queue is empty or operations are more than queue length
    	if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();

    	if (_operations > length || (index + _operations) > length)
        	_operations = length - index;
```

## Impact
`mintRollovers()` will not work as intended.
