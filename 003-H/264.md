# Rollover minting can be skipped after delisting

## Summary
`mintRollovers` use `rolloverAccounting` to remember the progress of rollover minting. But if someone deletes a rollover queue item, `rolloverAccounting` still stays the same and an item would be skipped from minting.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the rollover minting process just passes the rollover items to the next epoch, `rolloverAccounting` needs to store progress of minting for every epoch.
```solidity
  /* Carousel#mintRollovers */
  uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId]; // reload progress
  ...
  while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
      ...
          rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
          rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId; // pass to the next epoch
      ...
      index++;
  }

  if (executions > 0) rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = index; // save progress
```

If an user delists from the rollover queue, it overwrites the item to be removed with the last item of the queue, then pops it.
```solidity
    // overwrite the item to be removed with the last item in the queue
    rolloverQueue[index] = rolloverQueue[length - 1];
    // remove the last item in the queue
    rolloverQueue.pop(); //@audit need rolloverAccounting --;
    // update the index of prev last user ( mapping index is allways array index + 1)
    ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[rolloverQueue[index].receiver] =
        index +
        1;
    // remove receiver from index mapping
    delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
```

However if the index to be delisted was smaller than `rolloverAccounting`, then the newly overwrited item(which was originally the last item of the queue) would be skipped in the next `mintRollovers`.

## Impact

Contract would not work as expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Decrement the `rolloverAccounting` if needed.
```solidity
    uint256 latestEpoch = epochs[epochs.length - 1];
    if(index < rolloverAccounting[latestEpoch]) {
        rolloverAccounting[latestEpoch]--;
    }
```
