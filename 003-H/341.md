# [M-6] Rollover queue can be broken by user delisting executed rollover from queue

## Summary

If a user delists a rollover from the queue after it is executed, it causes a state where the function `Carousel.mintRollovers` fails and reverts.

## Vulnerability Detail

For the `Carousel.mintRollovers` function to work, the following condition must be true: `rolloverQueue.length` >= `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`. This means the length of the rollover queue must be greater than or equal to the number of rollovers executed.

However, this condition can be violated if a user:

- Enlists in the rollover queue by calling `enlistInRollover`
- Executes the rollover queue by calling `mintRollovers`
- Delists the executed rollover by calling `delistInRollover`


The user can do this because the `delistInRollover` function does not check whether the rollover was executed or not.

Therefore, when the keeper calls `mintRollovers` to execute other rollovers in the queue, the function will revert because `queue[index]` will be out of range.

## Impact

The rollover queue function can fail and prevent users from rolling over their deposits to the next epoch.

## Recommendation

Check whether the rollover was executed before delisting it. If it was executed, do not allow delisting.
