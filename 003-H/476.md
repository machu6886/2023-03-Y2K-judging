# Delisting a processed rollover item causes skip of unprocessed one

## Summary

If a rollover item is delisted after being processed, the last item in the queue will take its place and not be processed for this epoch

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `Carousel.delistInRollover` can perform a swap of the item to be deleted with the last item in the queue:

```js
} else {
    // overwrite the item to be removed with the last item in the queue
    rolloverQueue[index] = rolloverQueue[length - 1];
    // remove the last item in the queue
    rolloverQueue.pop();
    // update the index of prev last user ( mapping index is allways array index + 1)
    ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[rolloverQueue[index].receiver] =
        index +
        1;
    // remove receiver from index mapping
    delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
}
```

If the `rolloverQueue` is only partially processed and the value at `index` already has been rolled over, then this will cause the last item to take its place and not be taken into account when continuing the rollover.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fill the place with a dummy item (e.g. `assetValue == 0`) and perform the swap and pop when encountering it during the actual rollover function.
