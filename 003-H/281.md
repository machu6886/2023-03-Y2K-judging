# `Carousel::delistInRollover` can cause positions not to be rolled over

## Summary
delisting from the rollover queue can cause later enlists to not be rolled over to the next epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail
Similar to [this issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K-0ximmeas/issues/4).

Imagine a queue where there are two executed rollovers:

| Index | user  | rollover   |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| 0     | user1 | executed   |
| 1     | user2 | executed   |

`rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` will point to index 2 as that is the next one to roll over.

Now both doesn't want to participate in another roll over and decides to delist from the queue:
| Index | user  | rollover   |
| ----- | ----- |----------- |

The queue is empty but `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` still points at 2

Now Alice enlists and wants to roll over:

| Index | user  | rollover   |
| ----- | ----- |----------- |
| 0     | Alice | unexecuted |

If someone now tries to mint Alice rollover this row will revert as length is 1 and index is 2:

Now say that Bob also enlists, making the queue length 2 so that it will not revert:

| Index | user  | rollover   |
| ----- | ----- |----------- |
| 0     | Alice | unexecuted |
| 1     | Bob   | unexecuted |

Since `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` still points at 2 nothing will happen if a rollover is attempted.

Now lastly, Eve also wants to roll over, now a rollover can actually happen but Alice and Bob will miss out because `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` was still pointing at 2 (after minting, 3):

| Index | user  | rollover   |
| ----- | ----- |----------- |
| 0     | Alice | unexecuted |
| 1     | Bob   | unexecuted |
| 2     | Eve   | executed   |

Hence Alice and Bob will have missed out on a round of emissions and staking in the next epoch.

## Impact
Same as [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K-0ximmeas/issues/4). It will not only prevent a round of emissions for a user but more importantly, can stop a valuable position being rolled over. Increasing the shares to other positions and denying someone their share. Especially valuable if a depeg happens and someone is denied their insurance.

If this happens, a user can still delist themselves and re-list. However since rollover is an "afk"-feature it is unlikely they keep track on which index they have and will take action if this happens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` is higher or equal than the index delisted, decrease `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` one.
