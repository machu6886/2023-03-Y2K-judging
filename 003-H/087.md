# Some rollovers can't be processed due to the function `Carousel.delistInRollover`

## Summary
Some rollovers can't be processed due to the function `Carousel.delistInRollover`

## Vulnerability Detail
In each call, the function `Carousel.mintRollovers()` iterates through `operations` elements in the `rolloverQueue` starting from the element with `index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`. At the end of the call, the function will assign a new value for mapping `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` which is the latest index that the function has processed the rollover. Thus the value of `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` will be increased after each call. 

On the other hand, the function `Carousel.delistInRollover()` is used to delist a rollover from the array `rolloverQueue`. The way that the function operates can be described in the image below:

The flaw here is the function above can modify the order of elements in the `rolloverQueue` while the value of `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` can't be decreased. So it can lead to some scenarios that some rollovers can miss due to the execution of `Carousel.delistInRollover()`.

For instance,

As we can see in the image above, the 8th element can be processed because the current value of `rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = 5` is bigger than the current position of the 8th element (= 3)
