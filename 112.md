# User Funds Vulnerable to Index Manipulation

## Summary
A user can invoke the `enlistInRollover` function, potentially causing issues with the indices, which could result in users' funds becoming trapped within the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user first calls the `enlistInRollover` function, their request is added to the end of the `rolloverQueue` array. For example, if the user is the first person in the queue and deposits 1e18 tokens, the queue will appear as follows: [1e18 token, user, epoch2]. The `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[user]` will be set to 1.

Later, Alice joins the rollover with 1e18 tokens, and the queue becomes: [(1e18 token, user, epoch2), (1e18 token, Alice, epoch2)]. The `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Alice]` is set to 2.

Immediately after Alice's enlistment, the user calls the `enlistInRollover` function again with the same inputs as before (1e18 token, user, epoch2). Since the user still holds the epoch tokens, all validations will pass.

However, at line 268, the user's mapping changes: `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[user]` becomes 2. Now, both Alice and the user share the same index.

If the user decides to delist from the rollover, the last element will be removed as the length is now 2, reverting the queue back to: [1e18 token, user, epoch2]. This means that Alice is no longer participating in the rollover. Alice cannot `delistInRollover` anymore due to array out-of-bound limitations. Although Alice's `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` mapping remains valid at 2, she becomes stuck in the protocol. She cannot transfer tokens, withdraw, or update the rollover queue like the user did, rendering her funds non-recoverable. On the other hand, user still has a rollover position however he can transfer and withdraw his tokens freely since  `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[user]` is deleted after the 'delist' function

Alice can only get away from this situation if someone else joins to the queue and she does the same thing as User did to her. 
## Impact
Since this function is ruining the intended behaviour of rolloverQueue I'll consider it as a high finding.
