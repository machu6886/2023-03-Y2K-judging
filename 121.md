# TimeLocker Cannot Set Controller In Future After Owner has Set Once

## Summary
The timeLocker should be able to whitelist controllers in future according to the protocol, as the owner can only set a controller once.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the comments, the owner can whitelist a controller just once and after that in the future controllers are only whitelisted by the timeLocker. However, after the owner has whitelisted a controller, the implementation of the VaultFactoryV2.whitelistController function makes it impossible for controllers to be whitelisted in the future by the timeLocker. Instead of setting the new controller address to **True** it is set to **false**.
```solidity
        } else if (msg.sender == timelocker) {
            controllers[_controller] = !controllers[_controller];
```
## Impact
Can Cause malfunction of multiple features across the protocol as keepers depend on controllers  to trigger the events that condition the Vaults.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L208-L221
```soldity
    function whitelistController(address _controller) public {
        if (_controller == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (msg.sender == owner() && !adminSetController) {
            controllers[_controller] = true;
            adminSetController = true;
            emit ControllerWhitelisted(_controller);
        } else if (msg.sender == timelocker) {
            controllers[_controller] = !controllers[_controller];
            if (!adminSetController) adminSetController = true;
            emit ControllerWhitelisted(_controller);
        } else {
            revert NotAuthorized();
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making the TimeLocker able to whitelist controllers in the future.
```solidity
        } else if (msg.sender == timelocker) {
          -  controllers[_controller] = !controllers[_controller];
          +  controllers[_controller] = true;
```
