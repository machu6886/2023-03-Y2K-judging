# Increasing relayer fee is dangerous as it may break deposit queue

## Summary
Increasing relayer fee is dangerous as it may break deposit queue

## Vulnerability Detail
In Carousel when assets are deposited into the queue, they are supposed to be large enough to pay a relayer fee. It is enforced in `minRequiredDeposit` modifier
```solidity
    modifier minRequiredDeposit(uint256 _assets) {
        if (_assets < relayerFee) revert MinDeposit();
        _;
    }
```

However, if admin wants to increase the fee, it will also apply to deposits already in queue. If there are deposits in the queue that are smaller than the increased relayer fee, the deposit queue will break. In `mintDepositInQueue`, the execution will revert when subtracting relayer fee from deposit size
```solidity
uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee // reverts here
            );
            emit Deposit(
                msg.sender,
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }
```

Even if there are no deposits in the queue smaller than the new relayer fee, it is still dangerous to assign. The increase can be front-run by an attacker to add a small deposit and break the queue.

## Impact
Increasing relayer fee is too dangerous as it will allow the attacker to break deposit queue. Rolling back the change to unblock the queue will require waiting for a timelock.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Taking the fee during the deposit is a more sensible option. Deposits can't be withdrawn anyway so there is no difference in when to take the fee
