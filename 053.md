# Insufficient collateral for premiums

## Summary
It is important to ensure that premium callers are able to receive the correct amount of collateral after settlement. However, currently there are no checks in place when someone buys a premium call. To prevent this issue, the code should verify if there is enough collateral in the collateral vault to compensate the premium callers.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, let's say that in an epoch, there are 100 tokens in the premium vault and 10 tokens in the collateral vault. After the epoch auction is settled and there is a depeg, premium callers should be able to exercise their calls with the correct amount of collateral. The claimTVL of the premium vault would be 10, and the claimTVL of the collateral vault would be 100.

Now, let's imagine that Alice had deposited 10 tokens into the premium vault. When she withdraws, she will use the following formula: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L366

10 * 10 / 100 = 1

This means that Alice will only be able to withdraw 1 token, despite depositing 10 tokens as premium. Alice may not be able to exercise her full rights and may end up experiencing significant losses because the collateral vault was not liquid enough to accommodate Alice's premium.

## Impact
I am uncertain whether this design choice, where users depositing into the premium vault must consider the availability of sufficient collateral to ensure they receive a payout greater than their initial deposit, is intentional. I strongly recommend verifying the presence of adequate collateral when users deposit into the premium vault, so that premium depositors do not lose money if they win an epoch. I will categorize this issue as medium severity, assuming it is not a deliberate design decision.

## Recommendation
Check if there are enough collaterals for premium callers in deposit stage so that premium callers can exercise the right amount of collateral in settlement
