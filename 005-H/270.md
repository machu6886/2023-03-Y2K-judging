# Carousel.mintRollovers will mint less shares to users, resulting in the loss of users' assets

## Summary
Carousel.mintRollovers does not mint the user's profits from the last epoch as shares
## Vulnerability Detail
When minting shares for users in Carousel.mintRollovers, it does not take into account the user's profit portion.

```solidity
                    uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;
                    _mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint);
```
Consider the following scenario, where the relayerFee == 0.
alice deposits 10 asset in epoch A, minted as 10 share, alice calls enlistInRollover to add to the rollover queue.
In epoch B, alice profits 1 asset, while in mintRollovers, it burns alice's 10 shares, and mint 10 shares for alice. 
Actually, it should mint shares for alice's profits, i.e., it should mint 11 shares.
## Impact
The user loses his profit.
