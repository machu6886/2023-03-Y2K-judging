# User's profit of the previous epoch will be lost during the rollover process

## Summary
The `assetsToMint` value that is used in the rollover process is not properly calculated, leading to the loss of the user's profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Carousel` contract, users can pre-rollover their profit into the next epoch by calling `enlistInRollover()` function with the number of shares to rollover. The relayer will call the `mintRollovers()` function after the current epoch has ended to rollover the user's shares into the next epoch.

As shown in lines 396-399, the `entitledShares` value will be calculated, which is the actual value of shares. However, the `assetsToMint` value, which is the amount to be rollovered, is not equal to the `entitledShares` value. As a result, the different value of the `entitledShares` and `assetsToMint` will be lost in the contract.

## Impact
The user's profit from the previous epoch will be lost within the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend changing `queue[index].assets` to `entitledShares` at line 436.

```solidity
uint256 assetsToMint = entitledShares - relayerFee;
```
