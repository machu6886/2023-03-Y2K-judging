# Users can lose their profit when using a rollover mechanism

## Summary
Instead of minting a number of shares corresponding to `previewWithdraw()` return value, function `Carousel.mintRollovers()` just mints the origional`queue[index].assets` shares for the user when minting for rollover of a new epoch. 

## Vulnerability Detail
After an epoch is resolved, the users who deposited into the vault can get the profit/loss based on whether the de-peg events occur during the epoch time. 
Assume that a user who deposited 100 ETH into the Risk vault gets 10 ETH profit (he has 110 ETH in total) because there was no de-peg event is trigger during the epoch time. Instead of withdrawing the fund, he calls `Carousel.minRollover()` to reinvest all of his money for the upcoming epochs. 
```solidity=
function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
    external
    epochIdExists(_epochId)
    epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
    nonReentrant
{
    /// ... 
    
    while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
        /// ... 
        uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;
        _mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint);
        /// ... 
    }
}

```
However, the amount of shares that the user will be minted for the next epoch is just `queue[index].assets - relayerFee` which is just `100 ETH - relayerFee` instead of `110 ETH - relayerFee`. 
--> 10 ETH profit from the previous epoch is lost 
--> The user loses funds.

## Impact
Users lose their profit from previous epochs.

## Recommendation
Calculate the assetsToMint as follows: 
```solidity=
/// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L436-L437
uint256 assetsToMint = entitledShares - relayerFee;
_mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint);
```
