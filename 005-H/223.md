# Incorrect mint amount is used in mintRollovers()

## Summary

`mintRollovers()` use incorrect mint amount which will cause part of funds being locked in a vault forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [rollover mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L361) should be equal to `withdraw()` plus `deposit()`. The `assets` in the rollover queue represent how much share of an epoch that an user wants to rollover. The rollover gets minted only if user won the epoch he is rolling over. That means a user can withdraw more underlying token from the epoch then he deposited. So the rollover should be minted using the amount of `previewWithdraw(queue[index].epochId, queue[index].assets)` rather than `queue[index].assets`. Using `queue[index].assets` indicate that the extra bonus is not counted and will be left in vault forever (since each epoch has it's own finalTVL/claimTVL which is isolated from other epochs).

## Impact

1. User will not be able to rollover with correct amount (entitledShares).
2. Part of extra underlying token of an epoch will get locked in a vault forever.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
{
    // ...
    // ...
    while (...) {
        // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
        if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
            uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
                queue[index].epochId,
                queue[index].assets
            );
            // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
            if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                _burn(...);
                _burnEmissions(...);
                emissionsToken.safeTransfer(...);
                emit Withdraw(...);

                // @audit should be entitledShares - relayerFee
                uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;
                _mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint);

                emit Deposit(...);
                rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
                rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
                // only pay relayer for successful mints
                executions++;
            }
        }
        index++;
    }
    // ...
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate `assetsToMint` in `mintRollovers()` using `entitledShares` instead.

Record rollover queue index only when an item is pushed into queue.
```solidity
uint256 assetsToMint = entitledShares - relayerFee;
```
