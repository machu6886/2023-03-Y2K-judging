# Rolling over is never beneficial for users

## Summary
Users participating in rollover to the next epoch consistently lose money, even if they won the previous epoch.
## Vulnerability Detail
Epoch tokens are minted in a 1:1 ratio with deposits (after deducting the fee), but when a user engages in rollover, the maximum number of next epoch tokens they can obtain equals their rolled over previous epoch tokens, minus the relayer fee. Consequently, users are unable to claim profits, causing the earnings to remain trapped within the protocol.

Example:
Suppose both Alice and Bob each have 10 epoch2 tokens, and they want to rollover to epoch3. They deposit their tokens into the collateral vault.

When epoch2 ends and epoch3 deposits open, let's assume that Alice and Bob both won their epoch, meaning there was no depeg situation. Thus, they should be entitled to their capital plus premiums. However, once epoch3 begins, someone can call the "mintRolloverQueue" function, effectively preventing Alice and Bob from claiming their tokens. Both Alice and Bob will receive (10 - relayerFee) epoch3 tokens, but they won't be able to claim their profits (premium fees from epoch2). As a result, participating in rollover is never profitable for any user.
## Impact
I'm not certain if this issue is an intentional part of the protocol's design. However, the rollover process doesn't seem logical in any scenario if participants can't claim their profits for a won epoch. Users only lose the relayerFee portion of their capital and miss out on potential earnings from the won epoch, making it unclear whether this finding should be considered medium or high in importance. I'll label it as high since there are no financial reason to participate in rollover.
## Code Snippet

In this case, the code only verifies whether the epoch is won, but it doesn't provide the user with the amount they've won. Instead, the code mints the next epoch's tokens in the quantity of the rolled-over epoch tokens minus the relayerFee. Rolling over users profits are trapped in the protocol.

## Recommendation
Check what's the users claimable profit and send it when `mintRolloverQueue` executed
