# Users lose profit in `mintRollovers` from incorrect variable used

## Summary
If users win an epoch, they are credited `entitledShares` which is greater than `queueItem.assets`, but `assetsToMint` uses the latter instead, resulting in the difference being unaccounted for / lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
Minting rollovers only happen if the user won an epoch, where `entitledShares` is expected to be greater than `queueItem.assets`.
```solidity
uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
  queueItem.epochId,
  queueItem.assets
);
// mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
if (entitledShares > queueItem.assets) {
```

However, the `assetsToMint` is calculated as
```solidity
uint256 assetsToMint = queueItem.assets - relayerFee;
```

where `queueItem.assets` is used instead of `entitledShares`. The difference `entitledShares - queueItem.assets` is therefore unaccounted for.

## Impact
Users' profits are lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
- uint256 assetsToMint = queueItem.assets - relayerFee;
+ uint256 assetsToMint = entitledShares - relayerFee;
```

Technically, the same change can be applied for the minimum relayer fee check too:
```diff
- if (queueItem.assets < relayerFee) {
+ if (entitledShares < relayerFee) {
```
