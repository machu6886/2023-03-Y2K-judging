# Inablility to withdraw for users enlisted in depositQueue()

## Summary
Carousel users who are enlisted in depositQueue have no way to withdraw funds if their deposits are not processed. 
## Vulnerability Detail
##### Where: In [Carousel.sol- function _deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L470-L501)
##### When: When carousel users deposit with Epoch 0.
##### Description :     
**Consider a scenario** :
-   There is a user who wants to deposit in nextEpoch, so he calls deposit with Epoch 0.
-   In _deposit() functions, no shares are minted to this user for the underlying provided; only her entry is added in depoistQueue Array.
-  Now consider that her deposit is not processed due to some reason such as below
   - No one calls `mintDepositInQueue()`
   - Relayer does call `mintDepositInQueue()` but for limited operations
-  There is no way for user to call withdraw, as she hasn't been minted any shares. 
- Here, we believe functionality to withdraw is unnecessarily dependent on relayers calling mintDepositInQueue()

## Impact
- Permanent freezing of funds for users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider minting shares of **Id 0** for users who call _deposit() function with **epoch Id 0**, so that when withdraw is called, the user's shares are burned and underlying is returned.
