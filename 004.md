# No Transfer Of Ownership Pattern

## Summary
After the transfer of ownership, if the nominated owner is not a valid account the market might stop working properly as epochs can't be created.
## Vulnerability Detail
The VaultFactoryV2.sol contract allows the TimeLocker to transfer ownership. But this involves only a one step process transfer where there is only one check to see if the nominated address is zero address. It does not include a second security step pattern which ensures that the nominated owner accepts ownership ensuring the nominated owner is the valid, active and required account.

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address _owner) public onlyTimeLocker {
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }
```
## Impact
The current ownership transfer process involves the timeLocker calling **VaultFactoryV2.changeOwner()**. This function checks the new owner is not the zero address and proceeds to write the new owner's address into the owner's state variable. If the nominated EOA account is not a valid account, it is entirely possible the owner may accidentally transfer ownership to an uncontrolled account, breaking the **createEpoch()** function which depends on the **onlyOwner()** modifier.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address _owner) public onlyTimeLocker {
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        _transferOwnership(_owner);
    }
```
```solidity
    function createEpoch(
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint40 _epochBegin,
        uint40 _epochEnd,
        uint16 _withdrawalFee
    ) public onlyOwner returns (uint256 epochId, address[2] memory vaults) {
        vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketId];

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0)) {
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);
        }

        if (_withdrawalFee == 0) revert FeeCannotBe0();

        if (!controllers[IVaultV2(vaults[0]).controller()])
            revert ControllerNotSet();
        if (!controllers[IVaultV2(vaults[1]).controller()])
            revert ControllerNotSet();

        epochId = getEpochId(_marketId, _epochBegin, _epochEnd);

        _setEpoch(
            EpochConfiguration(
                _epochBegin,
                _epochEnd,
                _withdrawalFee,
                _marketId,
                epochId,
                IVaultV2(vaults[0]),
                IVaultV2(vaults[1])
            )
        );
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After implementing a zero address check, consider implementing a second step process where the nominated account needs to call an acceptOwnership() function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account.
