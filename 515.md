# A malicious user can deny user reward enlisted in rollover

## Summary
A malicious user can edit rolloverQueue amounts for other users and to deprive of potential rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
Developer intention was to set an unique index for each user enlisted in rollover and save it to `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex`.
But when an already enlisted user edits his entries, `  ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` is set to the rolloverQueue.length.

Let's take an example:

Alice calls `enlistInRollover` for the first time with 100 assets
            ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Allice] = 1
            rolloverQueue[0] is Alices data - OK

Bob calls `enlistInRollover` for the first time with 100 assets
            ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Bob] = 2
            rolloverQueue[1] is Bobs data -> OK

Allice calls for the 2nd time enlist in rollover with same amount, 100:
            Since Allice was prevously enrolled, `getRolloverIndex` returns 1-1 = 0 -> OK
```solidity
    function getRolloverIndex(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        return ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner] - 1;
    }
```
rolloverQueue[0] is updated - OK 
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Allice] = 2 -> inccorectly updated to the `rolloverQueue.length`

Alice calls for the 3rd time  `enlistInRollover` with  `relayerFee` amount. 
 `getRolloverIndex` returns 2-1 = 1 -> NOK( since it's Bobs index )
  rolloverQueue[1] is Bobs data ( not Alices) and and `queue[index].assets` is set to `relayerFee`.
  

When relayer will call `mintRollovers` Bob will get  `assets - relayerFee` which is 0 shares.
Moreover, Bob will not get his share of premium/ collateral for the assets amount he enlisted in rollover.

## Impact

Users can loose relayerFee amount + potential reward from premium/ collateral.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move `  ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;`  in same branch where QueueItem is pushed to rolloverQueue
