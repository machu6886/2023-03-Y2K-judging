# The user will lose part of fund from enlistInRollover function if makes a multiple deposit

## Summary
The user will lose part of his/her fund if  **"1"** make a deposit Carousel.sol#L78 , **"2"** then calls the enlistInRollover function Carousel.sol#L238, **"3"** and again make a deposit and **"4"** again call enlistInRollover function.

## Vulnerability Detail
as I checked the deposit function at Carousel.sol#L78, the user can make a deposit for an epoch multiple times and there is not any limit. in this function require conditions are :

- epochIdExists(_id)
- epochHasNotStarted(_id)
- minRequiredDeposit(_assets)
- nonReentrant
- AddressZero

then he/she can make the call to the enlistInRollover - Carousel.sol#L238 function to enlists in rollover queue. in this function require conditions are :

- epochIdExists
- minRequiredDeposit
- isApprovedForAll
- balanceOf

So, based on the deposit function logic and enlistInRollover function logic :

> if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
>             // if so, update the queue
>             uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
>             rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
>             rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
>         } else {
>             // if not, add to queue
>             rolloverQueue.push(
>                 QueueItem({
>                     assets: _assets,
>                     receiver: _receiver,
>                     epochId: _epochId
>                 })
>             );
>         }

1 / User makes deposit "_assets = 1000 " and then makes calls to the enlistInRollover function.

>             // if not, add to queue
>             rolloverQueue.push(
>                 QueueItem({
>                     assets: _assets,
>                     receiver: _receiver,
>                     epochId: _epochId
>                 })
>             );

Based on the if and else, there are two scenarios, update the queue and add to queue. in both scenarios, assets = _assets, will get save for user in the rolloverQueue[index]. this is the first time and add to queue block will get call and the assets = 1000 get saved.

2 / Usre makes another deposit  "_assets = 1000 " and again needs to make calls to the enlistInRollover function. this time, update the queue will get calls but based on the update the queue logic, again assets = 1000 get saved. 

The user has 1000 assets from the first call to the enlistInRollover function and this time value of rolloverQueue[index].assets should become 2000, but because of the wrong logic value of rolloverQueue[index].assets will get saved 1000.

>             // if so, update the queue
>             uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
>             rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
>             rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;

this time we are updating user rolloverQueue[index].assets, so the logic should be 

> rolloverQueue[index].assets = rolloverQueue[index].assets + _assets;

## Impact
if the user makes multiple calls to the deposit Carousel.sol#L78 , then calls the enlistInRollover function Carousel.sol#L238, the assets lower than the actual assets get stored for the user in the rolloverQueue[index].assets.

## Recommendation
when we are updating user rolloverQueue[index].assets, the logic should be 

> rolloverQueue[index].assets = rolloverQueue[index].assets + _assets;
