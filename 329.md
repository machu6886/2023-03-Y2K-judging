# Valid mints can be skipped in mintRollovers

## Summary

mintRollovers() skips a mint when `queue[index].assets < relayerFee`, while it is `entitledShares` of a user need to be checked vs relayer's fee as that's the current amount to be relayed to mint.

## Vulnerability Detail

`queue[index].assets` is an initial investment (or a part of it) of the user in a concluded epoch. Assets to be rolled over are represented by `previewWithdraw(queue[index].epochId, queue[index].assets)` as the point of rolling over is that withdraw wasn't performed yet.

This mean that if Bob the user deposited a minimal amount in the concluded epoch, won big as a result, and wants to invest further, enlisting to rollover. His request will be skipped based on the fact that his initial investment was too small (say it was min allowed and the deposit fee were applied), while that's not relevant as he now has the whole amount won which can pay the relayer fee, i.e. it's a valid queue entry.

## Impact

Some mints are skipped, while can be made, which can result in a loss for the corresponding users.

Given that this can happen only on a combination of small initial investment (so current shares are lesser than current relayer fee) and a win in the epoch ended, the severity looks to be medium.

## Code Snippet

mintRollovers() treats the initial stake in `queue[index].epochId` as a maximum possible payment for `relayerFee`:

```solidity
    function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        ...

        while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
            if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
                uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
                    queue[index].epochId,
                    queue[index].assets
                );
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
@>                  if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }

## Recommendation

Consider using `entitledShares` to check whether relayer fee can be paid:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L401-L406

```diff
            if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
                uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
                    queue[index].epochId,
                    queue[index].assets
                );
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
-                   if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
+                   if (entitledShares < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }
                    ...
                }
            }
```
