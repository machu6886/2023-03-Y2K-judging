# Attacker can delist another user's rollover

## Summary
When calling function`Carousel.enlistInRollover()`, mapping`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` is assigned with the value `rolloverQueue.length` even though it has already queued up.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `Carousel.enlistInRollover()` is used to let the `_receiver` enlist in the rollover queue.
```solidity=
function enlistInRollover(
    uint256 _epochId,
    uint256 _assets,
    address _receiver
) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
    /// ... 

    if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
        uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
        rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
        rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
    } else {
        rolloverQueue.push(
            QueueItem({
                assets: _assets,
                receiver: _receiver,
                epochId: _epochId
            })
        );
    }
    
    /// [$audit] bug here 
    ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;

    emit RolloverQueued(_receiver, _assets, _epochId);
}
```
Firstly, the function checks whether the `_receiver` has participated in the rollover queue. 
* If not it will push the new `QueueItem` into `rolloverQueue`. 
* Otherwise, the function will modify the value `rolloverQueue[index]` in which `index = ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] - 1`

The flaw here is in both cases, the function sets the value of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` to `rolloverQueue.length`. The attacker can abuse this by following these steps: 
* The attacker calls `Carousel.enlistInRollover()`
* The attacker waits until a new user joins in the `rolloverQueue`. At this time the corresponding index of the user is `rolloverQueue.length`. 
* The attacker call `Carousel.enlistInRollover()` to make the mapping `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker] = rolloverQueue.length`. 
* The attacker calls `Carousel.delistInRollover()` to delist the rollover from the innocent user --> the rollover can't be processed.

## Impact
Users' rollover can't be processed

## Recommendation
Just set the value of mapping `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` to `rolloverQueue.length` when the user hasn't queued up yet.
