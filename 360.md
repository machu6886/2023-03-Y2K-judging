# [HIGH] Userâ€™s fund can be locked forever, due to lack of sanity checks for _withdrawalFee

## Summary
If an admin calls VaultFactoryV2.createEpoch() with parameter _withdrawalFee higher than 100%, the epoch will never end and the user's funds may be locked into a contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
Admin uses the VaultFactoryV2.createEpoch() function to create an epoch. One of the arguments, _withdrawalFee, is stored as the epochFee for that epoch. The createEpoch() function checks that _withdrawalFee is non-zero, but does not validate that _withdrawalFee is greater than the maximum value (10000). If _withdrawalFee is a value greater than 10000 (100%), controllerPeggedAssetV2.triggerDepeg() and triggerEndEpoch() will cause DOS. The user will never be able to find the fund again. In addition, the y2k frontend does not show anything about epochFee, so users are likely to make deposits without question. 
Y2K Market Frontend: [https://www.y2k.finance/market](https://www.y2k.finance/market)

I think the severity to High because the maximum deposit on Y2K market was 2427 ETH ($**4,355,035**), which could lead to a loss of funds. Also, epochFee is unchangeable, so it is important to do sanity check on _withdrawalFee.

The tests below depict a situation where _withdrawFee is set higher than 10000, and both tests revert to underflow.

```solidity
function testTriggerDepeg() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        VaultV2(premium).deposit(epochId, 1 ether, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        VaultV2(collateral).deposit(epochId, 1 ether, bob);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // this should not revert.
        vm.expectRevert();
        controller.triggerDepeg(marketId, epochId);
    }

function testRriggerEndEpoch() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        VaultV2(premium).deposit(epochId, 1 ether, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        VaultV2(collateral).deposit(epochId, 1 ether, bob);
        vm.stopPrank();
        skip(10000000); // more than 1 day

        vm.expectRevert();
        controller.triggerEndEpoch(marketId, epochId);
    }
```

## Impact
Depositors cannot withdraw funds forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a Require statement that validate _withdrawalFee is less than 10000(100%)
