# Incorrect rollover queue index may cause DoS

## Summary

Incorrect index is updated in `enlistInRollover(...)`. It may cause DoS of function `mintRollovers(...)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` map is always [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268) using `rolloverQueue.length`. If a user has already queued up before and then trying to update the queued amount, it will cause his index point to other's record. This would allow a user to modify other's rollover queue record. Based on that fact, the amount in rollover queue may be incorrect and cause `_burn(...)` fail when calling `mintRollovers(...)`. Since the queue is poped sequentially, a failed rollover mint would block others from being minted to new epoch.

## Impact

1. A user may manipualte other's rollover queue record.
2. A user may pass `notRollingOver(...)` check with incorrect rollover queue record which means he can transfer/withdraw tokens while it's queued.
3. `mintRollovers(...)` may be DoSed by a failed rollover minting.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function enlistInRollover(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _assets, address _receiver) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
    // check if user has already queued up a rollover
    if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
        // if so, update the queue
        // ...
    } else {
        // if not, add to queue
        // ...
    }

    // @audit index should only be recorded if user has not in queue before
    ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;

    emit RolloverQueued(_receiver, _assets, _epochId);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Record rollover queue index only when an item is pushed into queue.
```solidity
function enlistInRollover(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _assets, address _receiver) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
    // check if user has already queued up a rollover
    if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
        // if so, update the queue
        // ...
    } else {
        // if not, add to queue
        // ...
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
    }

    emit RolloverQueued(_receiver, _assets, _epochId);
}
```
