# relayer can never successfully execute mintDepositInQueue and mintRollovers due to ERC1155's _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck

## Summary

As we all know, the **ERC1155** token of **OpenZeppelin** will call `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` internally when token transferring and minting. If `to` is a contract, `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` will callback to 'to contract'. Carousel is inherited from **ERC1155**. When a user deposits asset into Carousel, Carousel mints the equivalent amount of **ERC1155** tokens to the user. Before a new round of epoch is started, off-chain relayer calls `mintDepositInQueue` to process users' **pre-deposited** assets, and mints the corresponding **ERC1155** tokens to these users. Meanwhile, off-chain relayer also calls `mintRollovers` to burn the ERC1155 locked by the user in the previous round of epoch, and mints the ERC1155 token to these users in the next round. If there are **malicious receiver contracts** in the `depositQueue` or `rolloverQueue`, when a callback is triggered, **the malicious contract can either directly revert or make a infinite loop to exhaust gas, leading to DOS**. Therefore, relayer can never successfully call these two functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's begin DOS attack step by step. Here are two scenarios. Let's first look at **the first one**:

1.  attacker deploys a contract A and calls `Carousel.deposit(0, relayFee+1, A)`.
2.  time goes by, new round of epoch is coming. The `depositQueue` already has 100 `QueueItem`.
3.  relayer calls `mintDepositInQueue(newRoundId, 50)`, and the `QueueItem` of contract A is one of the 50 items to be processed this time.
4.  when `mintDepositInQueue` mints token for A, it callback to A. A's code triggers DOS. This transaction revert.
5.  relayer tries again to go back to step 3.

In summary, it is never possible for relayer to empty `depositQueue`.

Let's take a look at **the second one**,  assuming that the current epoch is E1 and the next round is E2:

1.  attacker deploys a contract A and calls `Carousel.deposit(E1, 3 * relayFee, A)`, _balances[E1][A] = 2*relayFee.
2.  attacker calls `Carousel.enlistInRollover(E1, 2 * relayFee, A)`.
3.  time goes by, round E1 finished, round E2 is coming. The `rolloverQueue` already has 100 `QueueItem`.
4.  relayer calls `mintRollovers(E2, 50)`, and the `QueueItem` of contract A is one of the 50 items to be processed this time.
5.  when `mintRollovers` mints token for A, it callback to A. A's code triggers DOS. This transaction revert.
6.  relayer tries again to go back to step 4.

In summary, it is never possible for relayer to handle `rolloverQueue` .

## Impact

Due to DOS attack, `depositQueue` or `rolloverQueue`  can't be processed in time. This will destroy the normal process of the protocol. In fact, this issue can also cause the relayer to pay a large gas fee, which does not exceed the gas limit for one block.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are two ways worth recommending:

- **remove the code of `ERC1155._doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck`** to prevent calls to untrusted code.
- Inside `Carousel._mintShares`, special handling is performed for the case where `to` is a contract.
