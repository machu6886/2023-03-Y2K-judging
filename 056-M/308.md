# Wrong treasury is being set for vaults from vaultFactory

## Summary
`VaultFactoryV2.sol` not just create vaults but also update/set few key information in vaults including setting a new `treasury`.
The `treasury` is an entity which gets fees from `premium` and `collateral` vaults and hence it is crucial to get it right.

## Vulnerability Detail
VaultFactoryV2 has a function `changeTreasury(_marketId, _treasury)`. This function set given `_treasury` as whitelisted in vaults and then set it as the treasury of vaults. But in reality this function is whitelisting the given `_treasury` param but disregarding the given `_treasury` param when calling `setTreasury()` instead using a state variable from factory and setting that as treasury.

See this code [snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L240-L243)
```solidity
   IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
   IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
   // Notice `treasury` being set has no `_` prefix.
   IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
   IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);
```
## Impact
Wrong address is being set as treasury for all vaults of the ecosystem and there will never be a separation of treasury across all vaults and VaultFactoryV2.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider setting proper treasury to vaults.
```solidity
   IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
   IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
   IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(_treasury);
   IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(_treasury);
```
