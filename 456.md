## Summary
The `enlistInRollover` function in the code contains an error that causes the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` mapping to be updated incorrectly. The error occurs because the code for updating the mapping is placed outside of an `else` loop, which results in the mapping being updated even when the `if` statement is run. This can lead to the mapping being updated to the wrong list index when a user has already queued up a rollover and runs `enlistInRollover` again.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function enlistInRollover(
    uint256 _epochId,
    uint256 _assets,
    address _receiver
) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
    // check if sender is approved by owner
    if (
        msg.sender != _receiver &&
        isApprovedForAll(_receiver, msg.sender) == false
    ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _receiver);
    // check if user has enough balance
    if (balanceOf(_receiver, _epochId) < _assets)
        revert InsufficientBalance();

    // check if user has already queued up a rollover
    if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
        // if so, update the queue
        uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
        rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
        rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
    } else {
        // if not, add to queue
        rolloverQueue.push(
            QueueItem({
                assets: _assets,
                receiver: _receiver,
                epochId: _epochId
            })
        );
    }
    ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;

    emit RolloverQueued(_receiver, _assets, _epochId);
}
```
(1) Let Attacker run `enlistInRollover` function first time `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker] == 0` else statement run and it will push `QueueItem` to `rolloverQueue` list and update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker] = rolloverQueue.length;`,
assume rolloverQueue.length = 5;

(2) Now normal user come and run `enlistInRollover` function which push it's `QueueItem` to `rolloverQueue`. because user push QueueItem so `rolloverQueue.length = 6` and it will update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[user] = 6`.

(3) Attacker run `enlistInRollover` function one more time because attacker has already queued up a rollover now this time if statement run. and because code(#L268): `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;` is outside if and else loop #L268 line of code will executed and it will update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker]=6` last element of list which is already assign to user who queued up a rollover previously. 

(4) now Attacker run `delistInRollover` function, in line #L286 code: `index = getRolloverIndex(attacker);` point to last user QueueItem  instead of attacker `QueueItem` and it will pop previous user `QueueItem`. also delete `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker]` 


```solidity
uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_owner);
uint256 length = rolloverQueue.length;
if (index == length - 1) {
    // if only one item in queue
    rolloverQueue.pop();
    delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
}
```

(5) attacker again run `enlistInRollover` because `delistRollover` function delete `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker]` now this time attacker can add `QueueItem` one more time.

(6) if any user add there `QueueItem` again attacker will follow 3, 4, 5 step again and replace user `QueueItem` with his `QueueItem`,and submit multiple `QueueItem` in `rolloverQueue` list.
## Impact

the attacker can repeatedly add their own `QueueItem` to the list and replace other users' `QueueItems`, and causing unexpected behavior in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

#L268 line of code `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;` move inside the else loop.
Updated code:

```solidity
function enlistInRollover(
    uint256 _epochId,
    uint256 _assets,
    address _receiver
) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
    // check if sender is approved by owner
    if (
        msg.sender != _receiver &&
        isApprovedForAll(_receiver, msg.sender) == false
    ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _receiver);
    // check if user has enough balance
    if (balanceOf(_receiver, _epochId) < _assets)
        revert InsufficientBalance();

    // check if user has already queued up a rollover
    if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
        // if so, update the queue
        uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
        rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
        rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
    } else {
        // if not, add to queue
        rolloverQueue.push(
            QueueItem({
                assets: _assets,
                receiver: _receiver,
                epochId: _epochId
            })
        );
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
    }
    

    emit RolloverQueued(_receiver, _assets, _epochId);
}
```
