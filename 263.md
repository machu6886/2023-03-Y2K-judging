# Users could be arbitrarily ejection from the rollover queue

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In case Bob has already queued up a rollover
Let's say: `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[address(Bob)] == X` 
and  `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[address(Alice)] == rolloverQueue.length - 1`
and `rolloverAccounting[epoch Y] == X+5`
epoch Y exists and has not started yet
`rolloverQueue.length == Z` and (X+5 < Z)

Bob will invoke [delistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L276-L304) this logic will execute

```solidity
else {
            rolloverQueue[index] = rolloverQueue[length - 1];
            rolloverQueue.pop();
            ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[rolloverQueue[index].receiver] = index +1;
            delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
        }
 ```
 So Alice queue will be `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[address(Alice)] == X`
 As we know  `rolloverAccounting[epoch Y] == X+5`
 
Now Alice thinks she will be in epoch Y But unfortunately, this will never happen
in this way, she could be only in the next epoch Y+1

## Impact
The logic of `delistInRollover()` could corrupt the rollover queue

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to check `rolloverAccounting[ ]` for the next epoch with `rolloverQueue[index]`
