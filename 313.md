# unbounded loop in view function leads to a dos

## Summary
unbounded loops in `getRolloverTVL` and `getDepositQueueTVL` functions will lead to a DOS
## Vulnerability Detail
In the carousal contract we can see there are two unbounded loops. Because the rolloverQueue and depostiQueue are infinitely large, the function may encounter an Out of gas problem.  the DOS issue can block external protocol integration that relies on these two functions to accurately retrieve the protocol TVL and also DOS the frontend website that relies on calling this function to display the protocol TVL.
the two unbounded loops can be viewed below.
```solidity
  function getRolloverTVL(uint256 _epochId)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 tvl)
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rolloverQueue.length; i++) {
            if (
                rolloverQueue[i].epochId == _epochId &&
                (previewWithdraw(
                    rolloverQueue[i].epochId,
                    rolloverQueue[i].assets
                ) > rolloverQueue[i].assets)
            ) {
                tvl += rolloverQueue[i].assets;
            }
        }
    }
```
```solidity
    /** @notice returns the total value locked in the deposit queue
     * @return tvl total value locked in the deposit queue
     */
    function getDepositQueueTVL() public view returns (uint256 tvl) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depositQueue.length; i++) {
            tvl += depositQueue[i].assets;
        }
    }
```
## Impact
Because rolloverQueue and depositQueue can be infinitely large. These view functions wich are vital to the protocol may run out of gas and not work entirely leading to a Denial Of Service. Users funds will be locked up in queue, this is a loss of potential funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add running total or an accumulator variable and update the total TVL when request is added or removed to avoid unbounded loop.
