# Carousel contract can run out of fund and revert when withdraw emission token very quickly

## Summary

Carousel contract can run out of fund and revert when withdraw emission token very quickly

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating a epoch with emission, the emission amount is set and transferred from the treasury contract

```solidity
    /** @notice Function to create a new epoch with emissions
    @param _marketId uint256 of the marketId
    @param _epochBegin uint40 of the epoch begin
    @param _epochEnd uint40 of the epoch end
    @param _withdrawalFee uint16 of the withdrawal fee
    @param _permiumEmissions uint256 of the emissions for the premium vault
    @param _collatEmissions uint256 of the emissions for the collateral vault
    @return epochId uint256 of the epochId
    @return vaults address[2] of the vaults
     */
    function createEpochWithEmissions(
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint40 _epochBegin,
        uint40 _epochEnd,
        uint16 _withdrawalFee,
        uint256 _permiumEmissions,
        uint256 _collatEmissions
    ) public returns (uint256 epochId, address[2] memory vaults) {
        // no need for onlyOwner modifier as createEpoch already has modifier
        (epochId, vaults) = createEpoch(
            _marketId,
            _epochBegin,
            _epochEnd,
            _withdrawalFee
        );

        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[0], _permiumEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[0]).setEmissions(epochId, _permiumEmissions);

        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[1], _collatEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[1]).setEmissions(epochId, _collatEmissions);
    }
```

In the Carousel vault, the user not only getting shares, but also get emission balance when depositing

Carousel#deposit -> _deposit -> _mintShares ->

```solidity 
function _mintShares(
	address to,
	uint256 id,
	uint256 amount
) internal {
	_mint(to, id, amount, EMPTY);
	_mintEmissions(to, id, amount);
}
```

-> mintEmissions

```solidity
function _mintEmissions(
	address to,
	uint256 id,
	uint256 amount
) internal {
	require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

	_emissionsBalances[id][to] += amount;
	emit TransferSingleEmissions(_msgSender(), address(0), to, id, amount);
}
```

Then user can use the emission balance to withdraw the emission balance in withdraw and in mintRollover as well

```solidity
_burn(_owner, _id, _assets);
_burnEmissions(_owner, _id, _assets);
uint256 entitledShares;
uint256 entitledEmissions = previewEmissionsWithdraw(_id, _assets);
if (epochNull[_id] == false) {
	entitledShares = previewWithdraw(_id, _assets);
} else {
	entitledShares = _assets;
}
if (entitledShares > 0) {
	SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledShares);
}
if (entitledEmissions > 0) {
	emissionsToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledEmissions);
}
```

calling the function previewEmissionsWithdraw

```solidity
    /** @notice returns the emissions to withdraw
     * @param _id epoch id
     * @param _assets amount of assets to withdraw
     * @return entitledAmount amount of emissions to withdraw
     */
    function previewEmissionsWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
    {
        entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(emissions[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
    }
```

however, in the function setEmission and safeTransferFrom when creatingEpoch, the emissions[id] is set to be the total amount of the emission balance, but the code above treat the emissions[id] as a multipler.

the total asset in the contract, however, is emissions[id]  + finalTVL[id], as we know, number a * number b grows much faster than number a + number b

then the contract can run out of the fund very quickly and withdraw emission balance will revert, as we can see if the POC in the edge case when if the emissions balance is even larger than the finalTVL in python

We assume both emission token and insurance token is 18 decimals

```python
ETH = 10 ** 18
asset = 1000000 * ETH
emission_amount = 100000000000 * ETH
final_tvl = 100 * ETH

# entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(emissions[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
withdraw = asset * emission_amount / final_tvl

total_asset = emission_amount + final_tvl

print("withdraw amount", withdraw)
print("total asset", total_asset)
print("withdraw amount larger than total asset?", withdraw > total_asset)
```

the running result is:

```python
withdraw amount 1e+33
total asset 100000000100000000000000000000
withdraw amount larger than total asset? True
```

As we can see, the previewed withdraw amount is already much larger than the total asset in the carousel

## Impact

If the contract run out of fund and the preivewEmissionWithdraw value is even larger than the total balance of the carousel,

the withdraw transaction revert and the mintRollover transaction revert as well

```solidity
// @note emission token is a known token which has no before transfer hooks which makes transfer safer
emissionsToken.safeTransfer(
	queue[index].receiver,
	previewEmissionsWithdraw(
		queue[index].epochId,
		queue[index].assets
	)
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol treat the emissioned amount as the total emissioned balance instead of a multipler to avoid running out of fund.
