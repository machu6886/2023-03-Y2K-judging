# Carousel doesn't follow checks effects interactions

## Summary
There are plenty of places where external calls are unnecessarily made before state is updated. Which makes Carousel non EIP-1155 compliant.

## Vulnerability Detail
Interoperability is a core concepts in DeFi. It relies on that state is properly updated before external calls are made. Even if there is no direct harm to be done to the protocol in question with doing state changes after external calls this might be causing issues and possible vulnerabilities in other interacting protocols.

Specifically `safeTransferFrom` and `_mint` where the [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#safe-transfer-rules) reads:

> **Scenario#6** : The receiver implements the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface and is the recipient of one and only one balance change (e.g. safeTransferFrom called).
> - **The balances for the transfer MUST have been updated before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on a recipient contract.**

That is arguably not followed in the Carousel implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L531-L538

Since emission balances are updated after the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called. Even though the `ERC1155` updates are done the intent of the standard is that all related state should be updated when the receiver hook is called.

## Impact
Not following check effect interactions and not being EIP-1155 compliant might break interoperability with other protocols.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor the above code to follow checks effects interactions:

Changes to emissions can be done before transferring/minting:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L201-L212

Deposit queue can be "popped" before minting shares:

Minting and transferring emissions can be done after changes to `rolloverQueue`:
