# Incomplete ERC1155 Compliance Due to Missing safeBatchTransferFrom Function

## Summary
The smart contract under audit, written in Solidity, is intended to be fully compliant with the ERC1155 token standard. The Y2K scope explicitly that contracts must comply with ERC1155 standard.

However, it lacks the implementation of the essential function safeBatchTransferFrom, which is required for full compliance. This omission can lead to compatibility issues with other contracts, systems, or tools that expect the audited contract to fully adhere to the ERC1155 standard. The absence of safeBatchTransferFrom impacts the contract's functionality and usability, and may result in unexpected behavior or reduced efficiency when managing multiple token transfers simultaneously.

Carousel.sol fails to comply with IERC1155-safeBatchTransferFrom

## Vulnerability Details

Carousel.sol does not implement IERC1155-safeBatchTransferFrom
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L218-L226

Standard specifically states:
```txt
MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).                      
```
Carousel.sol does not comply with ERC1155.


## Impact
Compatibility Issues: The contract's lack of full compliance with the ERC1155 standard may result in compatibility problems when interacting with other contracts, systems, or tools that expect complete adherence to the standard.
Loss of Functionality: The absence of the safeBatchTransferFrom function hinders the contract's ability to efficiently manage multiple token transfers simultaneously, resulting in decreased functionality.
Reduced Usability: Users may find it difficult to use the contract in conjunction with other ERC1155-compliant systems, as the missing function could lead to unexpected behavior or require manual adjustments in the code.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the safeBatchTransferFrom function to ensure full compliance with the ERC1155 token standard. This will help to prevent compatibility issues, maintain the intended functionality, and improve the contract's usability with other systems.
Conduct a thorough review of the ERC1155 standard and cross-check the contract's implementation to ensure that all required functions and features are present and correctly implemented.
Implement comprehensive automated tests to validate the contract's compliance with the ERC1155 standard, including tests specifically designed to verify the correct behavior of the safeBatchTransferFrom function. This will help to identify any compliance issues early in the development process and minimize the risk of future vulnerabilities.
