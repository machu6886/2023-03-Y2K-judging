# withdrawalFee is calculated wrong

## Summary
on` vaultfactoryV2.createEpoch()`  the fee is set based on this comment:
`@param _withdrawalFee uint16 of the fee value, multiply your % value by 10, Example: if you want fee of 0.5% , insert 5`
**fee value is multiplied by 10**

 but in `controllerPeggedAssetV2.calculateWithdrawalFeeValue()` the fee is divided by 10000 (instead of 1000):
```solidity
function calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(uint256 amount, uint256 fee)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 feeValue)
    {
        // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
        return amount.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
    }
```
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Fee value will be 0.1 what is intented
