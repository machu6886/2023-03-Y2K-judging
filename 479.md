# Funds from premium vault can get stuck after sending to collateral vault

## Summary

When an epoch ends without depeg and collateral vault has 0 TVL, funds from premium vault will get stuck in the collateral vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an epoch ends without depeg, the premiums from premium vault will be send to the collateral vault and the claim TVL will be set accordingly:

```js
//ControllerPeggedAssetV2.triggerEndEpoch
collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, collateralTVLAfterFee);
...
premiumVault.sendTokens(
            _epochId,
            premiumTVLAfterFee,
            address(collateralVault)
        );
```

If the TVL of the collateral vault has been 0 for that epoch, no one will be able to claim the funds.

The odds of that happening are low, since such an epoch could be resolved with `triggerNullEpoch`. However, the function `triggerDepeg` does account for it and forbids being called if any of the vaults has TVL 0, so `triggerEndEpoch` should too:

```js
if (
    premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0 ||
    collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0
) {
    revert VaultZeroTVL();
}
```

## Impact

Lock of funds

## Recommendation
Perform the same check (shown above) for `triggerEndEpoch`
