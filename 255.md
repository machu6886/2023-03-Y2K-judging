# Epoch can be started and not started at the same time

## Summary
In VaultV2, there are modifiers `epochHasNotStarted` and `epochHasStarted` which determines if the epoch has started or not.
```solidity
    modifier epochHasNotStarted(uint256 _id) {
        if (block.timestamp > epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
            revert EpochAlreadyStarted();
        _;
    }

    modifier epochHasStarted(uint256 _id) {
        if (block.timestamp < epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
            revert EpochNotStarted();
        _;
    }
```
As you can see, if `block.timestamp == epochBegin`, then it would pass both tests. It would set the contract's state as the epoch has started and also not started at the same time.

## Vulnerability Detail
`epochHasStarted` modifier is only used in `resolveEpoch`, which is called from the controller to trigger the end of epoch.
```solidity
    function resolveEpoch(uint256 _id)
        external
        onlyController
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasStarted(_id)
```
When there are no deposits, or a depeg occurred before the epoch begins, `triggerDepeg` or `triggerNullEpoch` could be called right after the epoch starts.
However, users can still deposit funds to Carousels since the modifier would not revert.
As a result, anyone can deposit funds, then withdraw it right after depositing.
```solidity
    function deposit(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
    )
        public
        override(VaultV2)
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasNotStarted(_id) // block.timestamp == epochBegin

    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(VaultV2)
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasEnded(_id) // epoch resolved

```
If the epoch ended as a depeg, withdrawal would return much more than the deposited assets, so anyone can drain all the assets and emissions from the contract by repeating deposit and withdraw.
```solidity
    /* VaultV2#previewWithdraw */
    entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
    // if claimTVL > finalTVL, entitledAmount > _assets
```

## Impact
Funds could be drained when depeg occurring right after an epoch starts

## Recommendation
Fix the modifier.
```solidity
    modifier epochHasStarted(uint256 _id) {
-       if (block.timestamp < epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
+       if (block.timestamp <= epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
            revert EpochNotStarted();
        _;
    }
```
