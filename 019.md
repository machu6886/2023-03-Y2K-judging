# Users cannot see their assets properly

## Summary
Amount of assets that users can see with `previewWithdraw` sometimes will not be the same as that they can withdraw.
E.x. if `epochNull[_id] == true` they will be able to withdraw all their assets, but with `previewWithdraw` they will might see 0.
It all will be clear in the recommendation section
## Vulnerability Detail
`mulDivDown` will revert if `finalTVL[_id] ==0`
```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
        public
        view
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
    {
        // entitledAmount amount is derived from the claimTVL and the finalTVL
        // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% lower than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 500 assets
        // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% higher than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 1500 assets
        entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
    }
```

## Impact
Users will not be able to see what's wrong with their assets.

## Recommendation
Move logic from `withdraw` to `previewWithdraw` so users will be able to see the same assets as they can withdraw
```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
        public
        view
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
    {
        if (epochNull[_id] == false) {
// need this `mulDivDown` will not revert, you can customize how you want
            if (finalTVL[_id] == 0) {
                entitledAmount = 0;
            } else {
                // entitledAmount amount is derived from the claimTVL and the finalTVL
                // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% lower than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 500 assets
                // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% higher than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 1500 assets
                entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
            }
        } else {
            entitledAmount = _assets;
        }
    }

```
