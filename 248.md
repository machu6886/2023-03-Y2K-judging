# Insufficient Validation of Epoch Timestamps Leads to Potential Misconfiguration

## Summary
The Vault Factories do not validate the timestamps of epochs provided by the administrative user. Consequently, it is possible for the _epochEnd timestamp to be earlier than the _epochBegin timestamp, or for the epoch to have an extremely short duration. This issue constitutes a misconfiguration vulnerability, which could lead to unintended behavior, incorrect processing of data within the contract, and potential disruption of the contract's functionality.


## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L137-L156

## Impact
1. Unintended Behavior: The lack of validation for epoch timestamps can result in epochs with illogical configurations, which may lead to unexpected behavior within the contract and negatively affect its operation.
2. Incorrect Data Processing: If epochs are not correctly configured, the contract may process data inaccurately or inefficiently, potentially affecting the performance and reliability of the contract.
3. Disruption of Contract Functionality: The improper configuration of epochs can cause disruptions in the contract's functionality, undermining user confidence and potentially rendering the contract unusable for its intended purpose.


## Code Snippet


```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Function set epoch for market,
     * @param  _marketId uint256 of the market index to create more assets in
     * @param  _epochBegin uint40 in UNIX timestamp, representing the begin date of the epoch. Example: Epoch begins in 31/May/2022 at 00h 00min 00sec: 1654038000
     * @param  _epochEnd uint40 in UNIX timestamp, representing the end date of the epoch and also the ID for the minting functions. Example: Epoch ends in 30th June 2022 at 00h 00min 00sec: 1656630000
     * @param _withdrawalFee uint16 of the fee value, multiply your % value by 10, Example: if you want fee of 0.5% , insert 5
     */
    function createEpoch(uint256 _marketId, uint40 _epochBegin, uint40 _epochEnd, uint16 _withdrawalFee)
        public
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256 epochId, address[2] memory vaults)
    {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Implement validation checks for the _epochBegin and _epochEnd timestamps to ensure that the _epochEnd timestamp is always greater than the _epochBegin timestamp. This will help prevent the creation of illogical epoch configurations and maintain the contract's intended behavior.
2. Introduce a minimum epoch duration to prevent extremely short epochs that could negatively impact the contract's performance and functionality. Ensure that this minimum duration is carefully considered based on the specific use case and requirements of the contract.
3. Implement automated tests to verify the correct validation of epoch timestamps and configurations. This will help identify potential misconfiguration issues early in the development process and reduce the risk of future vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider using formal verification techniques to further strengthen the validation of contract parameters.
