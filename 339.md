# [M-4] Incorrect update of ownerToRollOverQueueIndex index when rollover is already queued

## Summary

When a user has already queued a rollover and updates it, the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` mapping assigns the index of the last item in the queue to the user. It is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail

The rollover index in the queue for a user who has already queued a rollover should remain unchanged. However, it is erroneously changed to the last index in the queue, which belongs to a different user.

```javascript

        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;

```


## Impact

Incorrectly updating `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` has several consequences:
- A user cannot delist their own rollover.
- A user can delist another user’s rollover.
- A user can change the _assets and _epochId of another user’s rollover, which prevents that user from withdrawing or rolling over more or less of their funds in the next epoch (contrary to their risk assessment).
- If a user’s balance of semi-fungible tokens is less than `queue[index].assets`, the `mintRollovers` function will always revert and break the rollover functionality.

## Recommendation

Only update the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` if the user has not yet queue.

```dif
} else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
+        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
        }
-        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
