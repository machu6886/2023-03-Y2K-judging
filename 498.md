# Increasing relayerFee may result in lost funds

## Summary
When relayerFee is increase, all deposits in mintDepositInQueue may fail

## Vulnerability Detail
When deposits are queued, it needs to pass minRequiredDeposit(_assets). Assuming relayerFee is then increase, such that is exceeds one of the deposits, then when minRequiredDeposit is called, it will revert due to underflow.


## Impact
A malicious actor can monitor the mempool for relayerFee increases, and send a tx with bare minimum deposit, thus disable the entire  deposit queue.
