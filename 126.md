# Insufficient Chainlink feed validation

## Summary
ControllerPeggedAssetV2.getLatestPrice has insufficient Chainlink feed validation
## Vulnerability Detail
Since there is insufficient check for stale prices, a stablecoin could depeg and return to peg if while not being pickup due to stale prices.
While pegOracle does implement a check on this, it's not sufficient: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/oracles/PegOracle.sol#L79 (not sure if this contract is going to be used).
## Impact
Users that deposited a premium will not receive assets according to projects mechanism/ concept at depeg or other project economics could result in a loss.
