# Missing null epoch check in `triggerEndEpoch`

## Summary
There is no check for zero TVL in `triggerEndEpoch` meaning that null epoch can be treated like a normal one

## Vulnerability Detail
If any vault's TVL is zero the epoch is not considered valid and the funds are given back to depositors. No fees are taken and no balance transfers are made between the vaults. From `triggerNullEpoch`:
```solidity
        if (premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0) {
            premiumVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
            collateralVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);

            premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, 0);
            collateralVault.setClaimTVL(
                _epochId,
                collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId)
            );

            collateralVault.setEpochNull(_epochId);
        } else if (collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0) {
            premiumVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
            collateralVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);

            premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId));
            collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, 0);

            premiumVault.setEpochNull(_epochId);
        } else revert VaultNotZeroTVL();
```
However, it is also possible to call `triggerEndEpoch`, because this function does not check whether there is a vault with 0 TVL. It will take fees and transfer premium to collateral vault. This is vastly different from `triggerNullEpoch` behavior.

Let's say the epoch is invalid because there are no deposits to collateral vault. If `triggerEndEpoch` is called, premium depositors lose their funds as those will be transferred to collateral vault. On the other hand, with `triggerNullEpoch` they would have gotten them back since the epoch would be marked invalid.

## Impact
Premium depositors will not get their funds back in case of null epoch

## Recommendation
Revert `triggerEndEpoch` if either of the vaults has no deposits
