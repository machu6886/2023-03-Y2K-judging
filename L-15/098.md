# Non-compliance of EIP-1155 standard

## Summary
[`Carousel.safeBatchTransferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L218) overwrites the standard Open Zeppelin implementation with a hardcoded `revert()`, thus breaking the compliance with the EIP-1155 standard.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contest description states that the vault contracts should adhere to the EIP-1155 standard:
> Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?
A: Should comply wiht 1155 standart

Overwriting the `safeBatchTransferFrom` method, which is [part of the EIP-1155 standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md#specification), to always `revert` break the compliance.

## Impact
The vaults are not EIP-1155 compliant as mentioned in the contest description. Additionally this issue could break external third-party integrations expecting EIP-1155 compliance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not revert on `safeBatchTransferFrom` and instead implement the method's logic.

## Code Snippet
