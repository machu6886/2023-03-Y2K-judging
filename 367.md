# User may be not able to mint for rollovers

## Summary
A bad actor revert in the fallback function cause the ```mintRollovers()``` function not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```mintRollovers()``` function allows anyone to mint for rollovers. Inside the fucntion, the protocol will burn shares ,transfer tokens and [mint ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L437)ERC1155 NFT to receiver via `while` loop. However ,if the receiver is a contract and a bad actor revert in the fallback function. Then,the `mintRollovers()` function will not work.

while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
            if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
                uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(

                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
