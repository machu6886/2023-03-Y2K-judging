# Potential DDOS attack while processing deposit requests with epochId =0

## Summary
Users can place deposit requests for next epoch by choosing `epochId=0`. A new deposit queue item gets created each time a deposit request is raised by a user. 

Malicious user can create a large array of deposit requests by depositing an amount slightly over `relayerFee` to force relayers to execute the transaction. A FILO method (first in, last out) for executing requests can mean that early requests made by genuine users can be stuck. This can trap the deposits already made by such users with no potential exit.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`_deposit` in Carousel](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L496) creates a new `QueueItem` each time a deposit request is made with `epochId=0`.

[`mintDepositInQueue`](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L310) allows relayers to execute these requests in `first-in, last-out` order (FILO). Relayers have an option to pick a specific number of requests (`_operations`) and get paid `_operations*relayerFee` for executing those transactions.

If a malicious user creates a practically unlimited number of transactions, each with an amount equal to `relayerFees`, a relayer might find it uneconomical to execute those transactions. Gas cost of execution can be greater than the reward for execution. In such scenarios, early deposit requests placed by genuine users may never be processed by relayers

And since users have already transferred assets to the vault before generating a deposit request, such funds may be trapped in the contract with no potential refund

## Impact
DDOS attack can make relayer execution uneconomical that can trap user funds in the contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the same model for deposit requests as rollover requests. In roll-over requests, 1 receiver can only place 1 request. In this model, a user can deposit multiple deposits but as long as `receiver` is same, a single deposit request can keep incrementing the deposit request amount.

This will not only remove this attack vector but also reduce the cost paid by users to relayers
