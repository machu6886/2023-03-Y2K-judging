# Rollover Queue Manipulation

## Summary
An attacker can exploit the 'mintDepositQueue' function to create both rolling over and non-rolling over positions, which can lead to issues during epoch wins and rollovers. Specifically, the attacker can cause the rollover queue to fail, prevent others from receiving epoch tokens, and block rollovers.
## Vulnerability Detail
The 'mintDepositQueue' function can be exploited by attackers to create both rolling over and non-rolling over positions. For example, in epoch2 when deposits are allowed, an attacker can create two contracts, A.C1 and A.C2. A.C1 deposits 1 Ether for epoch2 and mints 1 epoch2 token, while A.C2 deposits 0.00001 Ether and mints 0.00001 epoch2 token (the smallest possible number up to the fee in a real scenario).

The attacker then enlists A.C1 to the rollover queue, which currently consists only of A.C1. Other users may join the queue, and assume that it now contains A.C1, Alice, and Bob. The attacker then rolls over the second contract, A.C2, to the queue, which is now [A.C1, Alice, Bob, A.C2].

When epoch2 is won and epoch3 is open, users in the queue can claim their epoch3 tokens. A.C1's 1 epoch2 token is burned, and when the loop reaches the _mintShares line, A.C1 re-enters the contracts delist function. This function swaps the last index of the queue with the delisted index, so A.C1 is popped out from the array and the new index[0] is A.C2. However, since A.C1 re-entered the function, it executes the lines after the delisting process, which updates the queue as [(A.C2, 1 token, 3), (Alice, X tokens, 2), (Bob, X tokens, 2)]. This update treats A.C2 as if it has 1 epoch3 token, although it does not.

When epoch4 comes, if someone tries to call "mintRolloverQueue", it will fail because A.C2 does not have 1 epoch3 token, and the burnFrom will fail. This means that the index will not grow, and all others after A.C2 will not be able to get their epoch4 tokens. Rolling over for epoch4 is impossible because A.C2 lacks the requested epoch3 tokens.

This also means that A.C1 now has 1 epoch3 token, while A.C2 still has 0.00001 epoch2 token and a position in the rollover queue. If the attacker wants to roll over to epoch4, they can send (A.C1 is not rolling over so he can send the tokens to A.C2) the 1 epoch3 token from A.C1 to A.C2 and call the mintRolloverQueue to receive epoch4 tokens in A.C2's account. If they choose to withdraw the 1 epoch3 token from A.C1, the entire epoch4 rollover queue will be blocked because A.C2 will not be able to perform the burnFrom.

In addition to this, Attacker can conduct this attack on all epochs making the rollover queues stuck.


## Impact
Since this function is ruining the intended behaviour of "mintRolloverQueue" function I'll label it as high!
