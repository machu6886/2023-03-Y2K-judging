# Carousel: deposit queue can be blocked if `relayerFee` is increased

## Summary
The deposit queue can be blocked if the `relayerFee` is increased.
This is because the amount to be deposited is checked to be at least the `relayerFee` when the deposit is queued.
Before the deposit is executed the `relayerFee` might be increased.

## Vulnerability Detail
Due to the increase of the `relayerFee` it does not hold true anymore that the assets to be deposited are at least as big as the `relayerFee`.

This means that the subtraction of the `relayerFee` in the `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue` function can revert due to underflow:

This means that all remaining deposits in the deposit queue are blocked.

## Impact
Deposit queue can get blocked.

The impact is not mitigated by the fact that the `relayerFee` can be decreased again. This is not a viable option since the `relayerFee` must be set to the new higher value such that minting deposits stays profitable. If the `relayerFee` is lowered again it becomes unprofitable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue` function needs to ensure that `relayerFee <= queue[i].assets` to prevent the revert.

However it is not clear how to deal with deposits that are no longer possible.

Send the deposits back to the receiver?
Confiscate them and send them to the receiver if he files a request with the protocol owner?
This is something the developer must decide how to do.
