# User can avoid paying deposit fee

## Summary
user can bypass deposit fee if id is set to 0
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_depostit` function the logic charges a fee only if a the id is set to anything else but 0. A user can set the epoch id to 0 in the queue and completely avoid paying such deposit fee when he goes to mint. The protocol does not collect a deposit fee from user when in fact it should have collected said fee. We can view the logic down below
```solidity
 function _deposit(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
    ) internal {
        // mint logic, either in queue or direct deposit
        if (_id != 0) {
            uint256 assetsToDeposit = _assets;

            if (depositFee > 0) {
                (uint256 maxX, , uint256 minX) = getEpochConfig(_id);
                // deposit fee is calcualted linearly between time of epoch creation and epoch starting (deposit window)
                // this is because late depositors have an informational advantage
                uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
                // min minRequiredDeposit modifier ensures that _assets has high enough value to not devide by 0
                // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
                uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
                assetsToDeposit = _assets - feeAmount;
                _asset().safeTransfer(treasury, feeAmount);
            }

            _mintShares(_receiver, _id, assetsToDeposit);

            emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
        } else {
            depositQueue.push(
                QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id})
            );

            emit DepositInQueue(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
        }
    }
```
This can be further seen by looking at the snippet below. When shares are minted through deposit queue, no fees are charged
```solidity
        // queue is executed from the tail to the head
        // get last index of queue
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            emit Deposit(
                msg.sender,
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }

```
As we can see if user is depositing via que and not direct deposit, he can avoid paying fee by setting the epoch id to 0
## Impact
The protocol does not collect a deposit fee from user when in fact it should have collected said fee. This is a direct loss of funds for the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we recommend the protocol adds checks to ensure a user pays fees when he should.
