# _calculateFeePercent function does not calculate deposit fees correctly

## Summary

[_calculateFeePercent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L508) is used to calculate the deposit fee on an user deposit when the user deposits tokens to any non-zero epoch id. Due to a small mistake in the formula, this returned fee is always zero, causing loss to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_calculateFeePercent` is written as below:

```solidity
    function _calculateFeePercent(int256 minX, int256 maxX) internal view
        returns (uint256 _y)
    {
        int256 maxY = int256(depositFee) * int256(FixedPointMathLib.WAD);
        _y = uint256( // cast to uint256
            ((((maxY) / (maxX - minX)) * (int256(block.timestamp) - maxX)) +
                maxY) / (int256(FixedPointMathLib.WAD)) // two point math // scale down
        );
    }
```

Here, 
- `minX` is epoch creation time and `maxX` is epoch starting time. 
- `maxY` is usually around 10^18. 
- `(maxX - minX)` is around 2 days worth of seconds, which is pretty small compared to `maxY`.
- So, `(maxY) / (maxX - minX)` is roughly has the order of `maxY` and has a  positive value.
- Since deposit can happen only before epoch starting time, `int256(block.timestamp) - maxX)` is a negative value with few days or hours worth of seconds. 
- So this product, `(((maxY) / (maxX - minX)) * (int256(block.timestamp) - maxX))` is negative and has roughly the order of `maxY`.
- To this negative value we are adding `maxY`, which results in a very small number.
- In the next step we divide this number by 10^18, which will result in a zero, which is returned to the `_deposit` function. 

## Impact

In almost all cases deposit fee is calculated to be zero, causing huge cumulative losses to the protocol.

## Code Snippet
The following poc was written, 

```solidity
function testDepositInQueue() public {
        uint40 _epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        uint40 _epochEnd = uint40(block.timestamp + 2 days);
        uint256 _epochId = 1;
        uint256 _emissions = 100 ether;

        deal(emissionsToken, address(vault), 100 ether, true);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin, _epochEnd, _epochId);

        vm.startPrank(USER);
        IERC20(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), 10 ether);
        vault.deposit(1, 2 ether, USER);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

The printed verbose output was:

    │   └─ ← ()
```

You can see that how the treasury(with address 0x777) is sent 0 tokens from the emit statement.

## Recommendation

The fee is supposed to increase as the current timestamp gets closer to epoch starting time, which is maxX. So what we need is, instead of `(int256(block.timestamp) - maxX)`, it should be `(int256(block.timestamp) - minX)`. This will be always positive and will be the correct formula.

```solidity
        _y = uint256( // cast to uint256
            ((((maxY) / (maxX - minX)) * (int256(block.timestamp) - minX)) +
                maxY) / (int256(FixedPointMathLib.WAD)) // two point math // scale down
```

So as we move further away from the epoch creation time to the epoch starting time, the deposit fee keeps increasing.
