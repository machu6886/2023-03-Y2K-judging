# Attackers can deposit into vaults after the de-peg event is triggered to steal the funds.

## Summary
When a de-peg event is triggered at `block.timestamp == epochBegin`, the attacker can deposit into the vault in the same block to get more funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `Carousel.deposit()` is used to mint shares for users when they deposit ETH into the vault.
```solidity=
function deposit(
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _assets,
    address _receiver
)
    public
    override(VaultV2)
    epochIdExists(_id)
    epochHasNotStarted(_id)
    minRequiredDeposit(_assets)
    nonReentrant
{
    /// ... 
}
```
The function let the user deposit in the epoch`_id` if the modifier `epochHasNotStarted(_id)` is satisfied. In other words, the user can deposit into epoch `_id` if the current `block.timestamp` is `<= epochConfig[_id].epochBegin`. 
```solidity=
modifier epochHasNotStarted(uint256 _id) {
    if (block.timestamp > epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
        revert EpochAlreadyStarted();
    _;
}
```
However, the de-peg event for an epoch can be triggered if the `block.timestamp` lies in the interval [`epochBegin`, `epochEnd`] which means `epochBegin <= block.timestamp <= epochEnd`. 
```solidity=
function triggerDepeg(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _epochId) public {
    /// ... 
    
    if (uint256(epochStart) > block.timestamp) revert EpochNotStarted();
    if (block.timestamp > uint256(epochEnd)) revert EpochExpired();
    
    /// ... 
}
```
So when a de-peg event is triggered at `block.timestamp = epochBegin`, users still can deposit into the corresponding epoch in the same block which creates an opportunity for the attackers to steal the fund.

For instance, 

0. Assume that, `epochBegin = 5`, `epochEnd = 10`.
1. When `block.timestamp = 5 (= epochBegin)`, function `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.triggerDepeg()` is called to trigger an de-peg event. 
--> Suppose that we have `finalTVL[HedgeVault] = 100`, `claimTVL[HedgeVault] = 200`
2. At the same block, the attacker deposits 100ETH into the HedgeVault (the attacker can deposit because `5 <= block.timestamp (=5) <= 10`).
3. The attacker immediately calls `Carousel.withdraw()` to withdraw his entitled deposited assets, he gets: 
`entitledShares = 100 * 200 / 100 = 200 ETH`
--> The attacker just uses 100 ETH to get 200 ETH which makes the users who call `withdraw()` later unable to claim their funds. 

## Impact
The attacker can steal the vault's fund

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Function `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.triggerDepeg()` just can be called when the `block.timestamp` lies in the interval [`epochBegin+1`, `epochEnd`] instead of [`epochBegin`, `epochEnd`].
