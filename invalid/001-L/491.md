# Freshness of pricefeed not checked properly

## Summary

Chainlink Pricefeeds are not checked for the `latestTimestamp` before using them. This can lead to the usage of stale pricefeeds.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the chainlink [docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/#check-the-timestamp-of-the-latest-answer), one "should track the `latestTimestamp` variable or use the `updatedAt` value from the `latestRoundData()` function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it". The protocol checks for sequencer state, and for roundId, but does not check when the price was last updated. This can lead to the protocol using stale values of the price oracle which can prevent a depeg trigger, or trigger premature depegs.

## Impact

Stale chainlink pricefeed values.

## Recommendation

Check the `updatedAt` value from the sequencer. If it is too old, revert or add some contingency.
