# Fee calculation inconsistencies

## Summary
At different instances different ways to calculate the fee are mentioned/ used.

## Vulnerability Detail
At L336 in `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol` it is said for a fee of 0.5% to input fee == 50 (fee percentage * 100) 
At L135 in `VaultFactoryV2.sol` it is said for a fee of 0.5% to input fee == 5 (fee percentage * 10) 

Throughout most other instances in the codebase `fee percentage * 100` is considered to be the valid one. 

I believe this to be a mistake and not a typo since at L135 in `VaultFactoryV2.sol` it is mentioned the following way: 
`@param _withdrawalFee uint16 of the fee value, multiply your % value by 10, Example: if you want fee of 0.5% , insert 5`

It would be understandable to be a typo if a 0 was omitted/ forgotten in one instance, but it was omitted/ forgotten twice - both in the explanation and the example. 

## Impact
Wrongfully setting the fee percentage - either 10 times more or 10 times less than intended.
