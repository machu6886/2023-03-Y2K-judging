# `changeTreasury` does not set vault treasuries correctly

## Summary

When the timelocker attempts to change treasury for a market, the treasury address for the associated vaults is not updated to the address supplied.  

## Vulnerability Detail

In `VaultFactoryV2.sol`, the `changeTreasury` function is used to change the treasury address for a market.  This function takes a `_treasury` address as one of it's parameters.

```solidity
function changeTreasury(
    uint256 _marketId,
    address _treasury
) public onlyTimeLocker {
```

Then, for both vaults, it whitelists the new treasury address but then sets the treasury address to default treasury address stored in the `VaultFactoryV2` contract instead of the one supplied by the timelocker.

```solidity
    IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
    IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
    IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
    IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);
```

## Impact

This can result in the market sending funds to the wrong address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the treasury address to the one supplied by the timelocker.

```diff
    IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
    IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
+   IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(_treasury);
+   IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(_treasury);
-   IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
-   IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);
```
