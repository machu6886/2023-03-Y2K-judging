# Improper checks on the return data of `priceFeed.latestRoundData();` in `triggerdepeg` may hold back premium carousel users from winning

## Summary
Improper checks on the return data of `priceFeed.latestRoundData();` in the function `triggerDepeg` may hold back premium carousel users from winning
## Vulnerability Detail
function `triggerDepeg` calls [getLatestPrice()](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L273.)  to check the current price of the token mean while in the check of return data of `priceFeed.latestRoundData();`
 the function reverts if the value of round ID is more than answeredInRound ( ie The round ID of the round in which the answer was computed ) missing the check if answeredInRound = roundID
```solidity
if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();
```
but its considered that the price is still valid even if `answeredInRound = roundID` , as an example at any arbitrary time if the price of the token reaches below the strike price with the condition being answeredInRound = roundID, it might get reverted due to improper checks leading to ruining the chance of winning of premium carousel users
## Impact
*  undermines assumption of fairness of the users 
* losing a chance of winning for premium users even its totally one sided bett
## Code Snippet
```solidity
273:           function getLatestPrice(address _token) public view returns (int256) { 
                .....
           (uint80 roundID, int256 price, , , uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed
            .latestRoundData();
299:        uint256 decimals = priceFeed.decimals();
                    .......
315:    if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();
```

## Tool used
Manual Review , reference audit reports :[HALLBORN AUDIT](https://2047863079-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FaSJHG27D6yEvbos52Fsy%2Fuploads%2F7EsqZ1Ikz62vfMneVDXG%2FNewOrderDAO_Y2K_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Draft.pdf?alt=media&token=cb5ae109-4107-4726-825a-e96d76081441) [3.8]

## Recommendation
Consider using proper checks on the return data 
```solidity

require ( answeredInRound >= roundID , " ... ") ;

```
or 

```solidity
 if (answeredInRound <= roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();

```
