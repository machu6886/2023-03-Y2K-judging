# Malicious admin can steal all assets in rollover and deposit queue by minting them to a new epoch

## Summary
_In Carousel:_

A malicious admin can 
1. create epoch with any start and end time, 
2. mint rollovers and deposit queue to the epoch
3. deposit a small amount to the other vault
and win big money with a little risk

## Vulnerability Detail
### 1- exploiting premium vault:
A malicious admin can go through these steps to steal all the money in premium vault's queues:
1. **create an epoch** with immediate start and end time: `createEpoch(mId, now+1, now+2)`
2. mint all assets in **deposit queue** to the epoch: `mintDepositInQueue`
3. mint all assets in **rollover queue** to the epoch: `mintRollovers`
4. **deposit** a few assets to the collateral epoch (_other users won't have a chance to deposit and the admin will have all shares_)
5. wait 1 sec for epoch to begin
6. wait 1 sec for epoch to end and finish the epoch: `triggerEndEpoch`
9. no depeg is triggered. so all the premium assets will be sent to the collateral vault. 
10. Admin have all shares of collateral epoch and can withdraw all assets

### 2- exploiting collateral vault:
Admin waits for a depeg to happen and then goes through the similar steps and trigger a depeg to get all assets in collateral vault's queue.

## Impact
Admin can get all assets in rollover and deposit queue

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Delegate epoch creation to timelocker only or set limitations for start and end time of epochs (start time should be at least 3 days after creation time so the others have a chance to deposit)
