# triggerDepeg can be front-runned

## Summary
triggerEndEpoch can be executed without check that a depeg event happened , users may by wrong or by front-running triggerDepeg escape from paying and transferring collateral to insurance buyers ( premium vault users ) . 
## Vulnerability Detail
triggerEndEpoch resolves epoch and then insurance sellers are able to receive their collateral + premium earned  .
in case of depeg , triggerDepeg resolves the epoch , transfers collateral to premium buyers and transfer premium to insurance sellers , triggerEndEpoch doesn't check strike price to ensure that there is no depeg event so users can triggerEndEpoch even if there is a depeg event , this allows them to front-run triggerDepeg and call triggerEndEpoch before it and escape from paying collateral to insurance buyers .
## Impact
Insurance sellers escape from paying to insurance buyers in case of depeg .
