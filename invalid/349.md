# Subtraction underflow in deposit flow if deposit fee is more than 100%

## Summary
Deposit fee is calculated linearly between time of epoch creation and epoch starting (deposit window).  This works okay as long as fee is less than 100% (less than `10000`). Problem is that there is no validations done to prevent setting up `depositFee` more than 100% .  When fee is more than 100% it will result in underflow error for late depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail
If depositFee is more than 100% then linearly calculated deposit fee will result in subtraction underflow for late depositors. 
Below method calculate feePercent based on deposit time in deposit window. 
```solidity 
uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
```
Assume depositFee is 200%.  Half time of deposit window already passed then linearly calculated fee will be greater than 100%. 
This will result in subtraction underflow in below line.

```solidity
   uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
   uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
    assetsToDeposit = _assets - feeAmount;
```

## Impact
Subtraction underflow in deposit flow when fee is greater than 100%

## Recommendation
Add validation and not allow setting up fee greater than 10000 points aka 100%
