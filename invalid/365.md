# [HIGH] Even if a depeg event occurs, triggerDepeg() may not be called, which will lead to different results from the intentions of the protocol

## Summary
If a depeg occurs and no one calls triggerDepeg(), it can pass as if the depeg event never happened, and users who deposited into the vault are not properly rewarded.

## Vulnerability Detail
If triggerDepeg() is not called for 1-24 hours after a depeg, the depeg event may never happen. For example, a pegging could occur again an hour after a depeg. Since the Y2K contract checks for depegs with latestRoundData, after the datafeed is updated, the value for the previous round cannot be retrieved and the user will not receive the correct reward even though the depeg occurred. Currently, Arbitrum-related stablecoins update their datafeeds once every 24 hours. The datafeed of stablecoins such as Ethereum chainlink DAI and FRAX is updated once an hour, and other tokens are updated up to once every 24 hours. As the number of Arbitrum-related chainlink nodes grows and evolves, the datafeed may be updated once per hour.
Scenario
1. DAI depegged, but no one call triggerDepeg() for 24 hours
2. DAI pegged again after few hours, and update feed.
3. Since Control contract is only using `latestRoundData()`, depeg event may not recorded. 

Scenario As mentioned above, Chainlink's datafeed update time is subject to change, and given that Ethereum's minimum datafeed update time is 1 hour, it is likely that Arbitrum's datafeed update time will also be shortened to 1 hour, which may result in users not being rewarded when a depeg occurs contrary to the intention of the protocol.

## Impact
User not correctly rewarded when depeg happens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend making 1 day delay after the epoch end to make verify de-pegging event. This can be done by using `.getRoundData(roundId)` instead of using `latestRoundData()`.
You may check the startAt variable, which is returned from `.getRoundData(roundId)`, is between epochStart and epochEnd.
This Recommendation is the same mitigation for the vulnerability that I submitted [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K-holyhansss/issues/4).
