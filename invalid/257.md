# withdraw not working as mentioned in the natspec.

## [M-01] `withdraw` not working as mentioned in the natspec.

## Summary

The _assets in withdraw have the following description:

```solidity
@param _assets uint256 of how many assets you want to withdraw, this value will be used to calculate how many assets you are entitle to according the vaults claimTVL;
```

The first part of the description is incorrect as _assets is actually the amount of vault tokens burnt. The next part of the description just adds to the confusion whether the amount of vault tokens to burn needs to be used or the amount of assets we need to withdraw needs to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

If according to the first part of the description the amount of assets a user wants to withdraw is used in the assets field, a user would first calculate the amount of assets a user wants to withdraw using the `previewWithdraw` and then use the returned value in `withdraw` ’s `assets` parameter. This would either transfer lesser value than expected or revert the transaction and user won’t receive the assets, when `epochNull[_id] != false` .

## Impact

There is no significant impact here to the protocol, but user’s won’t get the expected assets. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L141

```solidity
@notice Withdraw entitled deposited assets, checking if a depeg event
    @param  _id uint256 identifier of the epoch you want to withdraw from;
    @param _assets   uint256 of how many assets you want to withdraw, this value will be used to calculate how many assets you are entitle to according the vaults claimTVL;
    @param _receiver  Address of the receiver of the assets provided by this function, that represent the ownership of the transfered asset;
    @param _owner    Address of the owner of these said assets;
    @return shares How many shares the owner is entitled to, according to the conditions;
     */
    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either change the natspec comments, or the way `_assets` is used in the function.
