# Users should not invoke `enlistInRollover()` with an epoch not resolved yet

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Users should not invoke [enlistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238-L271) with an epoch not resolved yet
In case, Bob call `deposit()` with `_id = x`, and immediately invokes `enlistInRollover()` with `_epochId = x` (before epoch x start) The rollover suppose to take your deposit from one epoch to the next one, in this case, it is epoch x+1.
after that the **relayer** will invok `mintRollovers()` with `_epochId = x` (this will lead `rolloverAccounting[ ]`).

Now Bob thinks he will be automatically in the next epoch (in case he wins epoch x). But unfortunately, this will never happen

## Impact
The rollover of the user will be corrupted

## Recommendation
```diff
    function enlistInRollover(
        uint256 _epochId,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
-   ) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
+   ) public epochIdExists(_epochId) epochHasStarted(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {

   }
