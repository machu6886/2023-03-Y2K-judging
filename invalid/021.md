# Define MIN and MAX when you want to make change in the important storage variables

## Summary
If the deposit amount is lower than relayerFee, the user cannot call the deposit function and transaction will get reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit function at the Carousel.sol#L87 line is working based on the relayerFee. as you can see before any deposit, the contract will check that deposit amount is not lower than relayerFee, Carousel.sol#L739 else it will revert with error MinDeposit.

there is function at Carousel.sol#L602, and based on the onlyFactory modifre at VaultV2.sol#L419, only CarouselFactory contract at CarouselFactory.sol#L167 can make call to the this function to make change on relayerFee value. but in this function we just check that _relayerFee is more than 10000.

>         if (_relayerFee < 10000) revert InvalidRelayerFee();

Now if by mistake relayerFee value get change to large value, 

1 / then the user can successfully complete the deposit transaction **only if provide _assets amount greather than relayerFee.**
2 / based on the timelock queue function, **you have to wait a few days before you can enter the new amount and solve the problem**.
3 / the contract **has no pause / unpause functions to pause deposit** in the important situations like this.

## Impact
If the deposit amount is lower than relayerFee, the user cannot call the deposit function and transaction will get reverted.
