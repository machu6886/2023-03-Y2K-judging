# Frontrunner get advantage to deposit all fund of in a specific epoch

## Summary
There is a depositQueue where users will deposit funds when epochId is 0. User deposits fund this queue to use that fund for upcoming epochs.  Technically it is possible that two epochs exist at a time that have been created but not started yet and have overlapping deposit windows. `mintDepositInQueue` is a public method and anyone can call this method to deposit funds from the deposit queue to a specific epoch. Frontrunner may take advantage of this situation and deposit all funds in one specific epoch if he can profit from this situation.

## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned in summary, the frontrunner may take advantage when more than one epoch has deposit windows open at a time.
This vulnerability may be more serious when a depositor of a counterparty calls `mintDepositInQueue` and deposits all funds of the queue in the epoch in which the frontrunner gets most advantage.

## Impact
Front runner takes advantage and moves the deposit queue's funds to a specific epoch.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementation of the logic to handle front running problems in `mintDepositInQueue`. Also it can be beneficial to store user preference for epoch i.e. like to deposit in weekly epoch etc.
