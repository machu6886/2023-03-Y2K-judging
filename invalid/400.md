# Depeg events which occurs during the deposit period of an epoch are still considered valid in resolving the Epoch

## Summary

The [doc](https://y2k-finance.gitbook.io/y2k-finance/products/earthquake/mechanics) says:
> Note that depeg protection is only initiated after the deposit period ends. If a depeg event happens during the deposit period the vault will not strike

But this is not true. The depeg event can start during the deposit period, and continue to be depegged when the epoch starts. Anybody can then call the controller function to resolve the epoch as a depegged epoch. 

## Vulnerability Detail

During the deposit period, both premium and collateral users can deposit tokens into their respective vaults. During this period, its assumed that no one knows for certainty that whether a depeg will happen or not. 

And once the tokens are deposited into an epoch, there is no way to withdraw the funds before the epoch ends. So this means, if the depeg occurs during the deposit period, users will not be able to change their decision(they should be able to withdraw, as per commonsense) and withdraw their funds.

So lets consider the case of a depeg event occurring during the deposit period. 

1. The funds deposited as of now in the epoch are locked. 
2. The epoch begins after the deposit period. Suppose the depegged token price is still below the strike price.
3. Anyone can call the [triggerDepeg](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L51) function in the `ControllerPeggedAssetV2` contract  to resolve the epoch right after it started. 
4. As the conditions are valid, the epoch will be successfully resolved in favor of premium vault owners. 
 
But this is not right. As the events during deposit period shouldn't affect the epoch resolving.  

## Impact

The epoch can be resolved in favor of premium vault depositors if the depeg event occurs during the deposit period, and continue to be depegged when the epoch starts. 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode.

## Recommendation

Make the epoch invalid and let users withdraw their funds if a depeg event occurs during the deposit period and continues to do so until the start of the epoch.
