# epochResolved check will fail and delay rollover in `mintRollovers`

## Summary
For any given token and strike price a market is defined and in this market there can be multiple epochs ongoing at the same time. Current logic of `mintRollovers()` will assume the given epoch is latest and check that previous(current epoch - 1) is resolved and it will work if only 1 epoch is ongoing at any given time but that is not the case as per protocol design.

## Vulnerability Detail
During `mintRollovers()` call logic verifies that a given epoch is not started and the previous epoch is resolved.
```solidity
    	// prev epoch is resolved
    	if (!epochResolved[epochs[epochs.length - 2]])
        	revert EpochNotResolved();
```
Above logic clearly does not take multiple ongoing epochs into account.

Assume a scenario where epoch1 is for 1 week, epoch2 is 2 weeks and epoch3 is 4 weeks long and all epochs are ongoing at any given time. After epoch1 is over epoch4 is created for another weekly epoch and if user(s) from epoch1 are enlisted for rollover then these users will not be rollover as logic will check if epoch3 is resolved. Users who trust `mintRollovers` to be rollover will miss epoch4 as they will not be rollover for next 3 weeks at least in this scenario

## Impact
Users will not be rolled over to the new epoch and will not be able to take advantage of rollover features.
