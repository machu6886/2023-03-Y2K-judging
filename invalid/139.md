# Using `block.timestamp` to check if an epoch has started or ended, can be manipulated by miners.

## Summary
The contract uses `block.timestamp` to check if an epoch has started or ended, however the `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miners.
An attacker can exploit it to manipulate the "timestamp" and carry-out an `EpochResolved` event out of schedule, causing the loss of funds by the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows triggering an epoch end by the function triggerDepeg based on the current timestamp. The function calls the `EpochNotStarted()` and `EpochExpired()` functions to check if an epoch has started or ended. An attacker can modify the timestamp by including a manipulated timestamp in a new block, causing the function to execute earlier or later than intended, leading to undesired results.

In the diagram, the `triggerDepeg` function is shown calling the `EpochNotStarted()` and `EpochExpired()` functions to check if an epoch has started or ended, an attacker can manipulate the timestamp in a new block, causing the `triggerDepeg` function to execute earlier or later than intended, which may result in undesired outcomes.

The `block.timestamp` variable is used to check if an epoch has started or ended, which can be manipulated by miners, leading to a false result. Therefore, it is recommended to use `block.number` instead of `block.timestamp`.

```
In the diagram, the vulnerability in the smart contract is shown where `block.timestamp` is used to check if an epoch has started or ended and this can be manipulated by miners, leading to a false result.
The recommended improvement is shown as using `block.number` instead of `block.timestamp` to avoid this vulnerability.

## Impact
An attacker could manipulate the `block.timestamp` variable to trigger a transaction earlier or later than intended, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Replace all occurrences of `block.timestamp` with `block.number` in the `triggerDepeg` function.
