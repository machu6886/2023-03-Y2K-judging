# new ERC1155 tokens can be created without corresponding WETH collateral in VaultV2.sol and Carousel.sol because of unchecked return value

## Summary
The return value of deposit() isn't checked in depositETH() function, so the function assumes the transaction was successful.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function assumes the deposit was successful but the transaction could fail and in such situations the depositETH() function will go ahead to call  `_mintShares` to mint  new ERC1155 tokens.  
**A malicious actor could successfully mint new ERC1155 tokens without any prior deposit.**

## Impact
Now a Malicious actor could examine this code, see this vulnerability and look for a way to:
1. call the depositETH() function and deliberately make the transaction to fail.
2. mint a vast amount of new ERC1155 tokens without corresponding WETH collateral as the contract assumes his deposit was successful.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a require statement to ensure the transaction was successful, so that it will revert if it isn't.
like this:
```solidity
     require(IWETH(address(asset)).deposit{value: msg.value}(), "Deposit Failed!");
```
