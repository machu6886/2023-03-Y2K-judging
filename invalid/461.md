# Users get 0 shares when he deposit 'relayerFee' amount

## Summary
Protocol allow users to deposit to queueDeposits and to enroll in so called rollovers. In exchange for a rolloverFee funds can be minted into next available epoch/ rolled over. If the assets  to be minted/ rolled over are equal to relayerFee the user will get 0 shares back.

## Vulnerability Detail
   ```solidity
modifier minRequiredDeposit(uint256 _assets) {
        if (_assets < relayerFee) revert MinDeposit();
        _;
    }
```
Let's take an example:
Alice deposit `relayerFee` amount to epochId 0. The `minRequiredDeposit` modifier will not revert since the `_assets == relayerFee` .
Later relayer1 calls `mintDepositInQueue` to mint Alice deposit. Relayer fee is payed  to relayer1  and Alice will get back  `queue[i].assets - relayerFee` shares which means 0 shares. 

The same is happening to funds enlisted in rollover.

## Impact
Users who deposit/ enlist 'relayerFee' amount gets nothing in return.
