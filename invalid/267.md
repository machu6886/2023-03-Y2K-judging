# An attacker can prevent null epochs from occurring and take advantage of them.

## Summary
in VaultV2 and Carousel:
Before start of a null epoch, an attacker can deposit minRequired assets to prevent nulling the epoch and take advantage of all the money on the other side.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider these steps:

1.  An premium epoch is going to be null 
2. Before the start time the attacker deposits the minimum required assets (relayerFee+1) to the epoch
3. After epochStart, users can not triggerNullEpoch : `revert VaultNotZeroTVL()`
4. in case of a depeg: the attacker can get all assets of collateralVaults
5. in case of no depeg: the attacker just loses a little assets and collateral users get almost nothing

## Impact
Attackers can take advantage of null epochs before the start time
