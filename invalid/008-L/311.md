# Malicious user can Blocklists Token

# Malicious user can Blocklists Token

## Summary

The protocol currently uses these tokens:

> ERC20: [WETH, USDC, Y2K]
> 
Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are currently 200+ blacklisted accounts by USDC, these accounts are related to known hacks and other crime events.

## Impact

Malicious or compromised token owners can trap funds in a contract by adding the contract address to the blocklist.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Try to implement a try-catch solution where you skip certain funds whenever they cause the USDC transfer to revert.
