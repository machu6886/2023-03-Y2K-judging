# Before the beginning of an epoch there is no check to ensure that the depositQueue is cleared

## Summary

[mintDepositInQueue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L310) function in Carousel contract adds the deposit queue items into the upcoming epoch. Some items may be left out in the queue, which cannot be added to the epoch once it begins. There is no check to make sure that all the items in the queue are processed before the epoch finalizes. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two ways to deposit tokens into an epoch. 
1. By calling the `deposit` or `depositETH` function by mentioning a non-zero `_id` which corresponds to the specific `epochId` which you want to deposit your tokens into. 
2. By calling the `deposit` or `depositETH` function by mentioning a zero `_id`. 

In the second case the deposited tokens are queued into an array and a `relayer`, will add these funds for you, on your behalf, into the next available epoch. 

Technically the funds queued into the `depositQueue` are supposed to be cleared and accounted for the upcoming epoch. But if the deposit was done very close to epoch begin time, then a `relayer` might miss the final items in the queue. And once the epoch begins, [mintDepositInQueue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L310) function is locked out. 

This means that the user misses the opportunity to invest in the particular epoch and he cannot even withdraw the invested funds.

## Impact
 
 User loosing his investment opportunity. Funds being stuck in the contract until the end of the next epoch. 

## Code Snippet

Notice the `epochHasNotStarted` modifier which makes sure that the depositQueue cannot be processed once the epoch starts.

```solidity
    function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode.

## Recommendation

Time stamp of a deposit could be stored in the `depositQueue`. And those with timestamps less than epoch begin time, could be added to the epoch even after it begins for the sake of fairness.
