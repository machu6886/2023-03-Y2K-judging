# VaultV2: Ongoing epoch can be managed by non-whitelisted controller

## Summary
Controllers can be whitelisted and removed from the whitelist using the `VaultFactoryV2.whitelistController` function.

Vaults can only be created with whitelisted controllers, epochs can only be created if the controller of the Vault is whitelisted and controllers can only be changed to whitelisted controllers.

The issue is that a Vault does not recognize when its controller is removed from the whitelist.

This means that an ongoing epoch can be managed by a controller that is no longer whitelisted (e.g. because there is an issue with the sequencer feed that the controller makes use of)

## Vulnerability Detail
A controller can be removed from the whitelist using the `VaultFactoryV2.whitelistController` function:

However the `VaultV2` contract has no way of recognizing this and the check in its `onlyController` modifier will just pass:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L425-L428

This means the non-whitelisted controller (which means it is no longer trusted) can manage ongoing epochs.

I suggest that in this modifier it should be checked that the controller is whitelisted.

## Impact
A non-whitelisted controller can manage a Vault.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `onlyController` modifier in the `VaultV2` contract should be modified such that every time the controller wants to call a function, it is checked whether it is still whitelisted.
