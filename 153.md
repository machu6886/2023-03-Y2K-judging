# It is still possible for users to lose their funds when the counterparty vault has no deposits

## Summary
`triggerNullEpoch()` is implemented to protect against the case of when one side of the vault has no deposits. However, it is still possible for users to lose funds if `triggerNullEpoch()` is not called before the end of the epoch, as `triggerEndEpoch()` can now be called.

## Vulnerability Detail
`triggerNullEpoch()` can be called by anyone once epoch has started and doing so will allow users to withdraw their assets from the vault if counterparty vault is empty. However, in the case where this is not called, for various reasons such as a downtime on arbitrum or simply having no one calling the function, users can lose their deposits. 

The issue here is that `triggerEndEpoch()` can be called as long as `block.timestamp > uint256(epochEnd)`. This will lead to the same issue as found in H-04 in the previous Y2k audit done at C4. https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-y2k-finance-findings/issues/312

`triggerEndEpoch()` can be called regardless of whether it is possible to trigger null epoch. We should enforce the impossibility of it onchain and not rely or assume that `triggerNullEpoch()` will always be triggered before epoch ends.

## Impact
Users can lose deposits when counterparty vault has 0 deposits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an additional check to `triggerEndEpoch()` to disallow calling of it should one side of the risk/hedge vault have 0 deposits and prevent it from being callable even if `block.timestamp > uint256(epochEnd)`.
