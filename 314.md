# Math rounding in VaultV2.sol is not ERC4626-complicant: previewWithdraw should round up.

## Summary
Math rounding in VaultV2.sol is not ERC4626-complicant: previewWithdraw should round up.

## Vulnerability Detail
Per EIP 4626's Security Considerations (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)
Finally, ERC-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:

If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.
If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.

Then previewWithdraw in VaultV2.sol should round up.

The original implementation for previewWithdraw in Solmate ERC4626 is:
```
 function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply; // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

        return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivUp(supply, totalAssets());
    }
```

It is rounding up, however in the implementation of the VaultV2.sol#previewWith is not round up.

```
VaultV2.sol
357:     function previewWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
358:         public
359:         view
360:         override(SemiFungibleVault)
361:         returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
362:     {
363:         // entitledAmount amount is derived from the claimTVL and the finalTVL
364:         // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% lower than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 500 assets
365:         // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% higher than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 1500 assets
366:         entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
367:     }
368: 
```
note the line:

```
     if (epochNull[_id] == false) {
            entitledShares = previewWithdraw(_id, _assets);
        } else {
            entitledShares = _assets;
        }
        if (entitledShares > 0) {
            SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledShares);
        }
```
previewRedeem is round down.

and later we update guess and return guess
```
  entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
```
## Impact
 VaultV2.sol might wrongly assume that the functions handle rounding as per ERC4626 expectation. Thus, it might cause some intergration problem in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.
