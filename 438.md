# Carousel#enlistInRollover doesn't properly validate epochId causing assets of different epochs to be grouped

## Summary

Carousel#enlistInRollover groups deposits if the receiver already has an active rollover. It doesn't properly validate epochId and will group deposits with different epochIds into the same rollover request which will permanently DOS mintRollovers.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Carousel.sol#L253-L258](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253-L258)

        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {

When calling enlistInRollover it automatically overwrites the epochId of the the queued rollover. It never checks that this is the same as it was previously. 

[Carousel.sol#L408-L412](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L408-L412)

                    _burn(
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        queue[index].epochId,
                        queue[index].assets
                    );

If a user were to queue up a rollover for epochId == 1 for 10 then later for epochId == 2 for 10 then it will attempt to burn 20 of epochId == 2 when minting rollers. Since this will always fail, the function to permanently revert bricking rollovers. Only the user who created the request can remove it so a malicious user could use this to permanently break rollovers

## Impact

Rollovers are permanently bricked

## Recommendation

Check the epochId and either 1) revert if they don't match or 2) allow multiple deposits to be associate with a single address.
