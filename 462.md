# Lack of staleness check in the getLatestPrice(address _token) function can lead to triggering depeg even when there is no depeg.

## Summary
In controller` triggerDepeg() `function is dependent on the` getLatestPrice(_token)` function to get the price from chainlink and than check whether de-peg has occured or not. But de-peg can be triggered even when there is no de-peg.
## Vulnerability Detail
Lets consider a scenario: 
1. USDC Depeg occurs 30 minute before the epoch start, and as people have already participated with their deposits. 
2. USDC pegs back right before the epoch start time but the chainlink round that is going on extends few minutes to hour into epoch start time.
3. Now `triggerDepeg()` can be called successfully as it takes the stale price and reward the beneficiaries causing loss for other user even though asset was pegged back before the epoch time.

Concept ilustrated here: https://excalidraw.com/#json=zo0qQtXxpEBbrbU6ZJ70N,qKIIiwWfpJz5X8MphG4BgA

As chainlink round can be updated in few minutes to hour, chances of such scenerio to happen are very high.

Secondly the stale price check like this one is unnecessary for two reason :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L315

1. roundId is deprecated as answeredInRound and roundId are always same now, roundId don't leak.
2. Secondly our issue can cause within one round.



## Impact
Loss of funds for the collateral users even though depeg never occured.

## Code Snippet

 ```solidity
   function getLatestPrice(address _token) public view returns (int256) {
        (
            ,
            /*uint80 roundId*/
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt, /*uint256 updatedAt*/ /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
            ,

        ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }

        // @audit-issue - medium token to oracle problem will rise here
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
            vaultFactory.tokenToOracle(_token)
        );
        (uint80 roundID, int256 price, , , uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed
            .latestRoundData();
        uint256 decimals = priceFeed.decimals();

        // @audit-issue - high there should be a staleness check performed here

     
        

        if (decimals < 18) {
            decimals = 10**(18 - (decimals));
            price = price * int256(decimals);
        } else if (decimals == 18) {
            price = price;
        } else {
            decimals = 10**((decimals - 18));
            price = price / int256(decimals);
        }

        if (price <= 0) revert OraclePriceZero();

        // @audit - medium - submit with the staleness check this is deprecated
        if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();

        return price;
    }
```

## Tool used

## Recommendation

1. Add time based staleness check as https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L291
here.
2. Only let trigger happend and take price when it has been updated after epoch start time.
