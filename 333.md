# The getRolloverIndex() transaction could fail

## Summary
The `getRolloverIndex()` transaction could fail if user does not enlists in rollover queue or delists from rollover queue

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getRolloverIndex()` function needs to return the the rollover index for the owner.  However, if user does not enlists in rollover queue or delists from rollover queue, the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner]` will be 0, the transaction will fail when user calls the `getRolloverIndex()` function and get his rollover index.
```solidity
    function getRolloverIndex(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        return ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner] - 1;
    }
```

## Impact
The `getRolloverIndex()` transaction could fail if user does not enlists in rollover queue or delists from rollover queue

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Returns 0 when `QueueIndex` is less than or equal to 1
```solidity
    function getRolloverIndex(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner] <= 1)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        return ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner] - 1;
    }
```
