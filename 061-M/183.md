# Incorrect use of epochId according to instructions/ comments.

## Summary
Creation of epochId and usage of epochId per instructions do not match, resulting incorrect results when using `deposit()` or `totalAsset()`.
## Vulnerability Detail
`VaultFactoryV2.createEpoch()` creates the epochId by using `uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(marketId, epochBegin, epochEnd))`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L156

`VaultV2.deposit()` states "@param  _id  uint256 in UNIX timestamp, representing the end date of the epoch. Example: Epoch ends in 30th June 2022 at 00h 00min 00sec: 1654038000;"
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L89

This id is not converted with the same logic as in `.createEpoch()` hence the id will never exist. 
## Impact
Following the instructions of the comments, `deposit()` and `totalAsset()` will not work correctly and return incorrect value or revert. This could create issues in expectations when users or external projects interact with these functions.

## Recommendation
Adjust VaultV2.deposit to calculate the epochId like VaultFactoryV2 or adjust comments.
