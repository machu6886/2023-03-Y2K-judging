# Depositor can totally bypass deposit fee using deposit queue

## Summary
When the deposit is queue is being minted, the deposit fee is not deducted from the deposit assets.
Therefore the deposit fee is bypassable, losing funds for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the regular `deposit` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L479), if the user requested to deposit *in a certain epoch* (`_id != 0`), a deposit fee is being substracted from the amount that the user will receive.
```solidity
        if (_id != 0) {
            uint256 assetsToDeposit = _assets;
            if (depositFee > 0) {
                (uint256 maxX, , uint256 minX) = getEpochConfig(_id);
                uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
                // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
                uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
                assetsToDeposit = _assets - feeAmount;
                _asset().safeTransfer(treasury, feeAmount);
            }

            _mintShares(_receiver, _id, assetsToDeposit);
```
But if the *epoch id supplied is 0*, then the request will just be added to the deposit queue.
```solidity
        } else {
            depositQueue.push(
                QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id})
            );
```

Later, when [minting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L331) via `mintDepositInQueue`, we can see that no deposit fee is being deducted from the amount.
```solidity
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(queue[i].receiver, _epochId, queue[i].assets - relayerFee);
            emit Deposit(msg.sender, queue[i].receiver, _epochId, queue[i].assets - relayerFee);
            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }
```
Therefore, by choosing to deposit for the next epoch using the deposit queue, instead of the regular deposit function, a user can totally bypass the deposit fee.

Also note that since the deposit queue is "first in last out", and that whoever calls `mintDepositInQueue` will get the relayer fee, the user can straight away call it, mint his queued deposit and not pay the relayer fee either.

## Impact
A majority of protocol fees can be circumvented, leading to substantial loss of profit for the protocol.
Since this seems to fall under the category of "would result in a material loss of funds, and the cost of the attack is low", and we are not talking about an hypothetical scenario, I labeled this as high severity.

## Recommendation
Change the queue mechanism so fees would be taken there as well.
