# changeTreasury() misbehave

## Summary
VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury() does whitelist the new treasury address but set incorrect treasury.
Since it is admin function, this might not be accepted, but I just want to notify the protocol team about this.

## Vulnerability Detail
In VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury() should change treasury, but it only whitelists the address to vaults. This makes it harder to change treasury in the vault.
```solidity
IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury); // @audit-issue set treasury with previous treasury address
IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury); // @audit-issue 
```

To change treasury, more effort from the admin is needed. Here is scenario for the original code to change treasury in vaults

1. Admin calls VaultFactoryV2.setTreasury() to change to new treasury.
2. Admin calls VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury() with the same address used in step 1.

Correct scenario

1. Admin calls VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury() with new treasury address.

These are simple scenarios, but if the admin wants to change only for a specific market. It is harder than the above scenario.

## Impact
more effort from the admin is needed to change the treasury for a specific market.

## Recommendation
change the code to
```solidity
IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(_treasury);
IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(_treasury); 
```
