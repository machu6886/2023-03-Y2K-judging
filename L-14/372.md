# Trigger de-peg event may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs

## Summary
Based on the current implementation, when the protocol wants to use Chainlink oracle data feed for getting the token's price
In certain exceptional scenarios, oracles may become unavailable or the value of tokens can plummet to zero. In such situations, , no one can trigger the de-pegging event (all calls will revert)

## Vulnerability Detail
To trigger de-peg event you need to invoke [triggerDepeg()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L51-L138) which is get the price from `getLatestPrice()`
If a token's oracle goes down or the price falls to zero
```solidity
        if (price <= 0) revert OraclePriceZero();
```
call will revert

## Impact
trigger de-peg event may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs them most. As a result, the users who buy the insurance will receive nothing, when they should.

Make sure that there is a protective measure implemented to prevent this potential situation.
