# Treasury can never be changed on vaults even after calling changeTreasury()

## Summary
`changeTreasury()` in VaultFactory contract is meant to change the treasury on both the vaults of certain epoch ids but it doesn't do so.
## Vulnerability Detail
Look at the following code: 
```solidity
    function changeTreasury(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _treasury
    ) public onlyTimeLocker {
        if (_treasury == address(0)) revert AddressZero();

        address[2] memory vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketId];

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0)) {
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);
        }
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);

        emit AddressWhitelisted(_treasury, _marketId);
    }
```
setTreasury() when called on vaults wrong argument is passed into them, instead of passing _treasury, treasury is passed. So it never allows to change the treasury.

## Impact
It can lead to wrong distribution of funds when fee is transferred to treasury, funds maybe sent to wrong address or deprecated treasury

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add following code before calling `setTreasury(treasury)` on vaults
```solidity
setTreasury(_treasury)
```
this will set right treasury on factory.
2. Or pass the right argument _treasury when calling `setTreasury` on vaults
