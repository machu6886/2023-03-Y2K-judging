# The special case of “_epochBegin == block.timestamp” is undefined

## Summary
The special case of “_epochBegin == block.timestamp” is undefined, such that both epochHasNotStarted and epochHasStarted modifiers will allow further operations

## Vulnerability Detail
Since == is not taken into account, when comparing block.timestamp and epochConfig[_id].epochBegin, the system may get into weird states. For example, deposit() may happen after resolveEpoch() is called in the same block, thus ending up with inaccurate finalTVL[_id].
```solidity
    modifier epochHasNotStarted(uint256 _id) {
        if (block.timestamp > epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
            revert EpochAlreadyStarted();
        _;
    }

    /** @notice You can only call functions that use this modifier after the epoch has started
     */
    modifier epochHasStarted(uint256 _id) {
        if (block.timestamp < epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
            revert EpochNotStarted();
        _;
    }
```
## Impact
finalTVL[_id] may be set before deposit(), thus does not represent the actual full amount. Since a lot of calculations such as calculateWithdrawalFeeValue, previewEmissionsWithdraw depend on finalTVL[_id], those calculated results will be incorrect.

## Recommendation
Change to     
```solidity
modifier epochHasNotStarted(uint256 _id) {
        if (block.timestamp >= epochConfig[_id].epochBegin)
            revert EpochAlreadyStarted();
        _;
    }
```
