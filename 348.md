# A bad actor can revert in the callback function, causing the protocol to fail to mint deposit.

## Summary
If a bad actor  revert in the NFT fallback function, the protocol will be not able to mint deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintDepositInQueue()` is used to mints deposit in rollover queue. The protocol will execute the queue and mint ERC1155 NFT to receiver from the tail to the head  via a while loop . However ,if the receiver is a contract and a bad actor revert in the `IERC1155ReceiverUpgradeable(to).onERC1155Received` fallback function, the `Carousel` protocol will be not able to mint deposit for users.
```solidity
function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // make sure there is already a new epoch set
        // epoch has not started
        QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
        uint256 length = depositQueue.length;

        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();

        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();
        // relayers can always input a very big number to mint all deposit queues, without the need to read depostQueue length first
        if (_operations > length) _operations = length;

        // queue is executed from the tail to the head
        // get last index of queue
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );

```

## Impact
The protocol will be not able to mint deposit.
