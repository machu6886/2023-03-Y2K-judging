# `_withdrawalFee` incorect doc and lack maximum value check that can cause Vault to halt

## Summary

Newer `CarouselFactory` include max fee check for `_depositFee < 2.5%`.

`VaultFactoryV2` lack this check for `_withdrawalFee`.

This prevent Controller from withdraw or trigger end of epoch if `withdrawalFee` is set to more than 100%.

Also the doc comment for `_withdrawalFee` amount is incorrect both in doc and in test case. You might also want to check on that

Both `_withdrawalFee` in [doc comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L135) and `VaultFactoryV2` [test file in project](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/test/V2/FactoryV2Test.t.sol#L243) use this value`5 == 0.5%`, percentage with 1000 as demoninator.

But in actual implementation of [Carousel](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L486) and [Controller](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L337), the demonitator is 10000.

[The `Carousel` testfile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/test/V2/Carousel/CarouselTest.t.sol#L20) use correct fee percentage value, `50 = 0.5%`. This likely will be the value that deployment going to use.

## Vulnerability Detail

- `_withdrawalFee` During `VaultFactoryV2` Epoch initialization by admin, `withdrawalFee` [can set only once](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L176-L187). VaultFactory cannot replace epoch data as its [reverted by design](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L229).

- [The fee percentage demoninator is 10000](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L336-L337)

- If fee set to value > 10000. [All call depeg, end epoch will be reverted due to underflow error](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L175-L177). All users funds will be locked in this epoch.

## Impact

Because `Carousel` have automating enlist user share to latest epoch, if `withdrawalFee` is set to more than 100%, all user share will be locked in this faulty epoch. And the funds cannot be recovered even with admin intervention.

Medium severity because Sherlock trust in admin set correct variable. While the impact is locked fund in case of lost admin key.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include maximum value check for `_withdrawalFee` in `VaultFactoryV2` to prevent faulty epoch initialization.
