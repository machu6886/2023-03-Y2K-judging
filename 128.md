# Front-running risk in key admin actions

## Summary
The function `whiteListAddress` can be front-run

## Vulnerability Detail
The method `whiteListAddress`  from VaultV2 can be monitored for transactions and front-ran. Imagine the following scenario: 
  1. Bob is whitelisted 
  2. For some reason, the owner decides Bob is malicious and his whitelisted role should be removed, so he calls `whiteListAddress`
  3. Bob was expecting that and was already monitoring the mempool, so he is able to front-run the transaction and exploit his whitelist privileges (e.g. call `sendTokens` and send tokens to his malicious address)
  4. Now even though his whitelist privileges are removed, he still managed to exploit them. 

## Impact
Exploitation of rights, might lead to loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always execute transactions to the mentioned functions through a private mempool or redesign them so they are not front-runnable.
