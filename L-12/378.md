# Admins Cannot Create a New Market with a Different Underlying Asset Token but Same Insurance Token and Strike Price

## Summary
Admins cannot be able to create a new market with same `token` and `strikePrice` but a different `underlyingAsset` token as the `marketId` of a new market is being calculated using just token address and strikePrice as inputs.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`VaultFactoryV2.createNewMarket`](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L58-L128) function creates a new market by calculating a `marketId` using the [`getMarketId`](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L375-L381) function, which takes the token address and strike price as inputs. However, if an admin attempts to create a new market with the same token and strike price but a different underlying asset token, the VaultFactoryV2.createNewMarket  function will fail and revert. This is because the new market would also receive the same `marketId`, causing a conflict.

To clarify, when the`VaultFactoryV2.createNewMarket` function is used to create a new market, it first calls the `getMarketId` function, which takes the token address and strike price as inputs and returns a unique market identifier. However, since the `getMarketId` function only takes these two parameters into account, it is not able to differentiate between markets with the same token and strike price but different underlying asset tokens. As a result, attempting to create a new market with these parameters will cause a conflict, leading to the function reverting.

**Steps:**

1. Admin created a market in below configuration
   ```
     underlyingAsset = WETH
     token = USDC
     strikePrice = 0.9875
     ```
3. Later all the user of the system wants to deposit `stETH` as collateral and premium instead of `WETH`.
4. So now admin wants to create another market with below which accepts stETH as asset
    ```
     underlyingAsset = stETH
     token = USDC
     strikePrice = 0.9875
     ```
5. `createNewMarket` function will revert while creating the new market with stETH as both markets have same token and stike price because of the below check.
    ```solidity
    if (marketIdToVaults[marketId][0] != address(0))
                revert MarketAlreadyExists();
    ```

## Impact

The inability to create a new market with a different underlying asset token may render the protocol unusable in the future if users prefer to use a different token as the underlying asset, particularly if that token is more popular and widely owned by most users(ex: stETH).



## Code Snippet
```solidity
// marketId is calculated using token address and strikePrice
 function getMarketId(address token, uint256 strikePrice)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 marketId)
    {
        return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token, strikePrice)));
    }
```

        marketId = getMarketId(_marketCalldata.token, _marketCalldata.strike);
        if (marketIdToVaults[marketId][0] != address(0))
            revert MarketAlreadyExists();

       // ...
       
        marketIdToVaults[marketId] = [premium, collateral];

        // ...

        return (premium, collateral, marketId);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider calculating the marketId from `_marketCalldata.underlyingAsset` `_marketCalldata.token` and `_marketCalldata.strikePrice` instead of calculating it from `_marketCalldata.underlyingAsset` and `_marketCalldata.token` in `VaultFactoryV2.createNewMarket` function.

  ```solidity
  function createNewMarket(MarketConfigurationCalldata memory _marketCalldata)
          external
          onlyOwner
          returns (
              address premium,
              address collateral,
              uint256 marketId
          )
      {
          
          //  ...
  
     -   marketId = getMarketId(_marketCalldata.token, _marketCalldata.strike);
     +   marketId = getMarketId(_marketCalldata.underlyingAsset,_marketCalldata.token, _marketCalldata.strike);
          if (marketIdToVaults[marketId][0] != address(0))
              revert MarketAlreadyExists();
  
         // ...
         
          marketIdToVaults[marketId] = [premium, collateral];
  
          // ...
  
          return (premium, collateral, marketId);
      }
  ```
- Chane the getMarketId function as below.
    ```solidity
    function getMarketId(address underlyingAsset,address token, uint256 strikePrice)
          public
          pure
          returns (uint256 marketId)
    {
          return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(underlyingAsset, token, strikePrice)));
    }
    ```
