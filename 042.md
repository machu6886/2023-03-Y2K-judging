# VaultV2: `epochHasNotStarted` and `epochHasStarted` modifiers are not well-defined which can lead to loss of user funds

## Summary
The `VaultV2` contract defines the `epochHasNotStarted` and `epochHasStarted` modifiers.

They ensure that certain functions can only be called when the epoch has not started or has started.

The issue is that when `block.timestamp==epochBegin` both checks pass. I.e. the epoch has started and has not started at the same time.

This can lead to edge cases where in the worst case users lose their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's have a look at the checks that the modifiers perform and let's assume `block.timestamp==epochBegin`.

The check in `epochHasNotStarted` passes:
```solidity
if (block.timestamp > epochConfig[_id].epochBegin) 
         revert EpochAlreadyStarted(); 
     _; 
```

Also the check in `epochHasStarted` passes:
```solidity
if (block.timestamp < epochConfig[_id].epochBegin) 
         revert EpochNotStarted(); 
     _;
```

So what is the edge case that can occur that leads to a loss of user funds?

The issue comes down to the fact that a deposit can be made after the epoch has been resolved.

The `deposit` function checks that `epochHasNotStarted`:

The `resolveEpoch` function checks that `epochHasStarted`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L290-L299

As we have seen both checks pass when `block.timestamp==epochBegin`.

So what can happen is that a user wants to make a last second deposit but before his transaction is processed and within the same block the controller resolves the epoch and triggers a NULL epoch (assuming there were no funds in one of the Vaults prior to the deposit of the user) with the `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.triggerNullEpoch` function.

In the `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.triggerNullEpoch` function, the `claimTVL` is set which means that the user that performs the deposit in a later transaction of the same block cannot withdraw any funds.

## Impact
User funds can be lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The modifiers have to be well-defined.
To make it consistent with Controller logic the epoch should have started when `block.timestamp==epochBegin`.
This means that the check in `epochHasNotStarted` should not pass in this case.
