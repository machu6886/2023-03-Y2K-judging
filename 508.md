# Outdated staleness check of price feed

## Summary

Checks for stale price data are outdated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getLatestPrice` checks for stale data like this:

```js
if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();
```

According to https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133890/chainlink-latestrounddata-security-fresh-data-check-usage the variable `answeredInRoundId` is a legacy variable and the check for staleness should be based on the `updatedAt` parameter of the `latedRoundData` function.

## Impact

outdated staleness check could cause price data to pass checks even though stale
