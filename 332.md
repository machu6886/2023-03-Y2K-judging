# DOS attack to getDepositQueueTVL()

## Summary
The getDepositQueueTVL() function will return the whole array of `depositQueue`. It will run out of gas if a malicious user deposits with small amounts for a long list of wallet addresses or there is already a lot of deposit queue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The getDepositQueueTVL() function needs to return the whole array of `depositQueue` in memory, which needs memory copy operation. As a result, when the list is too long, it will run out of gas.
Meanwhile, a malicious can deposit with small amount for a long list of wallet addresses to increase the length of the array `depositQueue`.
As a result, it creates an effective DOS to the getDepositQueueTVL() function.
```solidity
    function getDepositQueueTVL() public view returns (uint256 tvl) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < depositQueue.length; i++) {
            tvl += depositQueue[i].assets;
        }
    }
```


## Impact
The function getDepositQueueTVL() is not useful anymore when there is a DOS attack.

## Recommendation
Revise the function getDepositQueueTVL() into getDepositQueueTVL(from, to) so that we can retrieve the deposit queue within a range of indices.
