# Timelock execute is not payable

## Summary
The function `execute` in Timelock.sol uses `.call{value: value}()` but is not marked as `payable`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In Timelock.sol, the `execute` function can be used to make arbitrary calls. As discussed with the sponsor, it is intended to also make payable calls, but since this function does not have the `payable` modifier, the call will revert.

## Impact
This is a medium impact issue because it breaks function intentions/specs (as per discussion with Sponsor). Since the function is not marked as `payable`, there is no way to call this function with any value, as it will revert.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making the `execute` function `payable`. It is also possible to add a `receive()` function to accept Eth.
