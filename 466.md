# Users might have different epoch than they want.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L476
When users deposit to the carousel, and If they want to deposit in the next epoch, they can set epochId to 0, and they will be pushed to DepositQueue. And then, relayers can use mintDepositInQueue() function to mint users shares.

But relayers can select epochId to whatever they want. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L334-L338
So they can mint users shares other than the next epoch.
    
## Impact
Users might have different epoch than they want.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
mintDepositInQueue() should only be callable for the next epoch.
