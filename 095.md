# Carousel: `getRolloverTVL` function returns ERC1155 balance instead of TVL

## Summary
The `Carousel.getRolloverTVL` function is supposed to return the total value locked in the rollover queue for a given `_epochId`.

The issue is that this function returns the wrong result.
It is supposed to return the total value locked, i.e. the underlying assets of the Vault. However it returns the ERC1155 vault tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function just sums up the `assets` field of each queue item:

However 1 vault token might be worth e.g. 2 WETH.

The number of underlying tokens that `assets` is worth needs to be calculated as:
```solidity
previewWithdraw(
    rolloverQueue[i].epochId,
    rolloverQueue[i].assets
)
```

## Impact
The returned TVL is wrong which leads to wrong calculations in any components relying on this function.
