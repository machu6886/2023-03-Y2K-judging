# Users can bypass the fee when depositing in the vault

## Summary
Users can bypass the fee when depositing in the vault by using the function `mintDepositInQueue`

## Vulnerability Detail
Users have 2 options to deposit into a vault. The first option lets the users specify a particular `epochId` and the protocol will charge a percentage of `_assets`. The second one allows users not to define which `epochId` they want to deposit in and gives this duty to the `relayer` who can be anyone to choose the `epochId` that the users will be minted the shares. After that, the `relayer` can take `relayerFee` ETH as a fee to process the transaction.
```solidity=
function _deposit(
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _assets,
    address _receiver
) internal {
    // mint logic, either in queue or direct deposit
    if (_id != 0) {
        uint256 assetsToDeposit = _assets;

        if (depositFee > 0) {
            (uint256 maxX, , uint256 minX) = getEpochConfig(_id);
            uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
            uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
            assetsToDeposit = _assets - feeAmount;
            _asset().safeTransfer(treasury, feeAmount);
        }

        _mintShares(_receiver, _id, assetsToDeposit);

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
    } else {
        depositQueue.push(
            QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id})
        );

        emit DepositInQueue(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
    }
```

The `relayer` processes the transactions by calling the function `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue()` to mint the shares corresponding to each element in the array `depositQueue`. Note that the `depositQueue` is executed in FILO order (from the array's tail to the head). This execution order creates a flaw in the "taking fee mechanism" which let the users deposit in the expected `epochId` without paying any fee. 

For example, 
1. Alice wants to deposit x ETH in the vault with `epochId = 4`.
2. Alice calls `Carousel.deposit(_id = 0, _assets = (x + relayerFee) ETH, _receiver = Alice)`. 
Because Alice set the `_id = 0`, the deposit will be added to the tail of the `depositQueue` array.
3. Alice immediately calls `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue(_epochId = 4, operations = 1)`. As we can see that Alice is the `relayer` in this function call, then she can gain `x - relayer` shares of the `epochId = 4` and get back the `relayerFee` ETH.

Note that Alice can write a smart contract to execute step 2 and step 3 in the same transaction which helps her bypass the deposit fee. 

 
## Impact
Users can bypass the deposit fee.

## Recommendation
Consider sending a portion of `relayerFee` to treasury instead of transferring all of the fees for `msg.sender`.
