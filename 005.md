# TimeLock has ability to transfer ETH but cannot receive it

## Summary
The `TimeLock` contract has been changed in comparison to Earthquake V1.

In V1 the `TimeLock` was only able to call specific functions that were not payable, now it can call any function.

The issue is that the `TimeLock` is now allowed to send ETH along with function calls but there is no way to fund the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `TimeLock` contract now allows to send ETH along with function calls:

```solidity
(bool ok, bytes memory res) = _target.call{value: _value}(data);
```

However there is no way to send ETH to the `TimeLock` contract.

## Impact
The `TimeLock` contract is supposed to allow sending ETH along with a transaction but this is not possible since it cannot receive ETH.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should be possible for the `TimeLock` contract to receive ETH such that it can be sent along when executing transactions.

This can be achieved by adding the following `receive` function to the contract:
```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```
