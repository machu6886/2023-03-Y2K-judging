# Code is broken if emission token has different decimals

## Summary
Code is broken if the emission token has any decimals besides 18
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Carousel.sol` contract there is a function, `previewEmissionsWithdraw`.
```solidity
 function previewEmissionsWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
    {
        entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(emissions[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
    }
```
The function does multiplication and division. the tvl is in 18 decimals. This means any emission token that does not have 18 decimals as well will completely break computation and lead to immense losses.

For example, the finalTVL is set based on the protocol insurance token from the controller when either triggerDeg or triggerEndEpoch or TriggerNull Epoch

If the insurance token is 18 decimals and the protocol decided the emmissions token is usdc with 6 decimals. 

When the above function goes to compute entitledAmount , since the funtction assumes both values will always be 18 decimals, a mismatch will completely miscalculate the entitledAmount by many decimals points, leading to a very large loss of funds..
## Impact
The protocol will suffer immense loss of funds due to incorrect assumption that emmisions token will always have 18 decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend that either the emissions token is always 18 decimals, or the protocol add logic to handle different decimals tokens in the function.
