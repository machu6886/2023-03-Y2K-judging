# changeTreasury in VaultFactoryV2 contract doesn't change the treasury address correctly

## Summary

[changeTreasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L228) in `VaultFactoryV2` contract doesn't change the treasury address of a particular market. It only whitelists the new treasury address.

## Vulnerability Detail

Looking at the `changeTreasury` function, 

`_treasury` is the new treasury address and `treasury` is the current address which is a state variable. `vaults[0]` and `vaults[1]` are premium and collateral vaults. 

```solidity
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);
```

Probably a typo, the developers passed the current treasury address of the factory contract to the  `setTreasury` function. This means, once set, the treasury address cannot be changed under any circumstances.

## Impact

It would be impossible to change the treasury address once its set. Depending on the circumstances under which the treasury change was initiated, this issue could even cause fund loss to the protocol.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function changeTreasury(uint256 _marketId, address _treasury)
        public
        onlyTimeLocker
    {
        if (_treasury == address(0)) revert AddressZero();

        address[2] memory vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketId];

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0)) {
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);
        }

        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);

        emit AddressWhitelisted(_treasury, _marketId);
    }
```

Manual Review, VSCode.

## Recommendation

Correct the code as shown below:

```solidity
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(_treasury);
```
