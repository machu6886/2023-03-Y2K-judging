# DoS Attack via createNewMarket Function due to Lack of Duplicate marketId Check.

## Summary
`createNewMarket` function in the contract has a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to create a DoS attack.
The vulnerability arises due to the lack of a check to prevent the creation of a new market with a duplicate `marketId` before the creation of the vaults, as a result, an attacker can create an arbitrary number of vaults, depleting gas causing a DoS attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable code is in the `createNewMarket()` function of the contract, the code creates a new market by creating two new vaults, one for premium and one for collateral, the market ID is generated by calling the `getMarketId()` function.
If a market with the same ID already exists, the function reverts.
```solidity
function createNewMarket(MarketConfigurationCalldata memory _marketCalldata)
    external
    onlyOwner
    returns (
        address premium,
        address collateral,
        uint256 marketId
    )
{
    ...
    marketId = getMarketId(_marketCalldata.token, _marketCalldata.strike);
    if (marketIdToVaults[marketId][0] != address(0))
        revert MarketAlreadyExists();
    ...
}
```
However, the check for an existing market ID is done after the vaults are created, which means that an attacker can create arbitrary vaults and consume significant amounts of gas before the function reverts.

I demonstrated the vulnerability through the following steps:

```
The diagram represents the vulnerability proof sequence, where the Rinkeby test network deploys the contract, and the `createNewMarket()` function is called twice with the same market ID. The transaction logs box verifies the transaction logs, which show that the first transaction succeeded, but the second transaction reverted.

## Impact
An attacker can create a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by creating an arbitrary number of vaults and depleting gas.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to prevent the creation of a new market with a duplicate `marketId` before the creation of the vaults, this will ensure that an attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability to create a DoS attack.
Additionally, I suggest the contract owner should consider increasing the gas limit to prevent a DoS attack from being executed by an attacker.
