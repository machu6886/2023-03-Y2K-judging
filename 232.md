# No way for users to opt out and get their funds returned before epoch starts.

## Summary
Once a user has deposited into an epoch, there is no way to change their mind even before an epoch begins and get their funds back.
## Vulnerability Detail
Once a user calls the **deposit** or **depositETH** functions, they are already locked into an epoch even before it has begun, there is no way to change their mind. Should there be a sudden change in market conditions that cause them to want to back out of their position there is no way.
## Impact
A user is unable to opt out of an epoch before it begins and has to wait till it it is resolved to get any funds back should there be any due at that stage. This locks in user funds even if they decide to withdraw before the epoch starts.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L148-L192
The withdraw function only has a modifier to check that the epoch has ended
```solidity
function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasEnded(_id)
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
```
and there is no other function to withdraw funds before an epoch has begun.
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add functionality via a separate function or by modifying the existing withdraw function to allow users to get funds returned before an epoch has started.
