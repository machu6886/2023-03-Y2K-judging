# Users can avoid paying depositFee

## Summary
Users can deposit in queue (passing epochId == 0) and and call `mintDepositInQueue`  in same transaction to avoid paying any fees. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When using the Carousel an user can choose to make a direct deposit (eg. in the next available epoch id) or a queue deposit, pushing the deposit information into `depositQueue`. 
When epochId != 0 a `depositFee` is paid to `treasury`. 
But when epoch id == 0 `depositQueue` is updated. Calling `mintDepositInQueue` will mint the corresponding shares to the rightful depositors. No deposit fee is paid to treasury. 

An user can deposit to epoch 0 and in same transaction to call `mintDepositInQueue` to ensure no deposit fee is paid and he receive back the relayerFee.

## Impact
Protocol will not receive the deposit fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Direct deposit fee is calculated linearly between time of epoch creation and epoch starting. Since queue depositors have no informational advantage a fixed % fee for epoch 0 deposits can be applied in this case.
