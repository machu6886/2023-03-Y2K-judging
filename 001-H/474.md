# Deposit fees can by bypassed

## Summary

The deposit fees are not accounted for when using the deposit queue mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Carousel._deposit` the full input amount is added into the queue:

```js
//WARDEN: fees handled if not put into queue:
if (depositFee > 0) {
    (uint256 maxX, , uint256 minX) = getEpochConfig(_id);
    // deposit fee is calcualted linearly between time of epoch creation and epoch starting (deposit window)
    // this is because late depositors have an informational advantage
    uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
    // min minRequiredDeposit modifier ensures that _assets has high enough value to not devide by 0
    // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
    uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
    assetsToDeposit = _assets - feeAmount;
    _asset().safeTransfer(treasury, feeAmount);
}
...
//WARDEN: when put into queue, no fee deduction happens
depositQueue.push(
    QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id})
);
```

In `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue` only relayer fees are subtracted when minting shares:

```js
_mintShares(
    queue[i].receiver,
    _epochId,
    queue[i].assets - relayerFee
);
...
asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _operations * relayerFee);
```

This way a user could bypass deposit fees by putting them into the queue and minting the deposit right after, so that relayer fees also end up back with them.

## Impact

Deposit fees can be bypassed, causing loss of revenue for the protocol

## Recommendation
Handle deposit fees before pushing them into queue. Make sure to adjust `minRequiredDeposit`.
