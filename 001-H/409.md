# User can bypass treasury tax

## Summary

The Carousel document on excalidraw implicitly show vault will take fee on Deposit and send them to treasury.

In `Carousel.sol`, deposit only take linear fee if deposit directly into epoch.
But if users use the deposit Queue or deposit into epoch 0. The contract does not take fee but take relayerFee which is significantly lower.

The Relayer function `mintDepositInQueue()` can be called by anyone.
So user can just call this function directly to deposit their fund without paying depositFee.

It is reasonably to assume the relayerFee is gas fee for Relayer while depositFee is penalty for late deposit.

It makes sense for deposit tax to take both relayerFee (fixed fee) and depositFee (percentage fee).

## Vulnerability Detail

- All deposit call just check user send enough to cover relayerFee with `minRequiredDeposit` modifier
- For deposit into epoch 0, aka deposit queue, [it push new `QueueItem` into `depositQueue` array.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L495-L497)
- `mintDepositInQueue()` is public with same variable check as `deposit()` function.
- `mintDepositInQueue()` use loop impelements FILO (first in last out). This mean user only need to call loop with length of 1. Or 1 operations to reach user queue that just got deposited.
- User now deposit into epoch that they want without paying depositFee.

## Impact

Lost treasury fee. `relayerFee` is 1e9 which is insignificant compare to `depositFee` percentage of 0.5%.
