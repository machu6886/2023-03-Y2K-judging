# Enlisting in rollover might assign a wrong index

## Summary

`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` assigns an incorrect index when an update is performed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `enlistInRollover` sets `rolloverQueue` for the user:
```solidity
        // check if user has already queued up a rollover
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
However, the last line does not respect the previous if/else statements, it just assigns the index to the queue length. If the update was performed, no item was pushed to the array thus it will return a wrong index. This last element might belong to another user.

## Impact

When updating the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` it messes up the index. Users lose their real indexes and this makes it possible to delete other users' queue items later (`delistInRollover`).

## Recommendation

Assign the correct index in both cases.
