# Lack of CEI in `mintRollovers` can be exploited by users two inflate their shares amount

## Summary
Because storage is updated after minting the shares, a malicious attacker can enter `delistRollover` using `onERC1155Received` to inflate the shares amount of another user.

## Vulnerability Detail
minting of shares in rollover is done before updating storage

```solidity
Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol
437: _mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint); //@audit reenter delistInRollover
438:                     emit Deposit(
439:                         msg.sender,
440:                         queue[index].receiver,
441:                         _epochId,
442:                         assetsToMint
443:                     );
444:                     rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
445:                     rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
```

`_mintShares()` mints shares to the depositor, in the form of an ERC1155 token. `ERC1155._mint()` has a safety hook to ensure the receiver handles this type of tokens:

```solidity
File: Earthquake/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol
285: _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
...
467: function _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(
468:         address operator,
469:         address from,
470:         address to,
471:         uint256 id,
472:         uint256 amount,
473:         bytes memory data
474:     ) private {
475:         if (to.isContract()) {
476:             try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, data) returns (bytes4 response) {
477:                 if (response != IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {
478:                     revert("ERC1155: ERC1155Receiver rejected tokens");
479:                 }
480:             } catch Error(string memory reason) {
481:                 revert(reason);
482:             } catch {
483:                 revert("ERC1155: transfer to non ERC1155Receiver implementer");
484:             }
485:         }
486:     }
```

This can be exploited by a depositor:
if they use a smart contract to deposit, and have the following logic in `onERC1155Received`: call `delistRollover`

This will delete them from the queue, and **place the last user at their index**

```solidity
File: Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol
292: } else {
293:             // overwrite the item to be removed with the last item in the queue
294:             rolloverQueue[index] = rolloverQueue[length - 1]; //@audit key part of the attack
295:             // remove the last item in the queue
296:             rolloverQueue.pop();
297:             // update the index of prev last user ( mapping index is allways array index + 1)
298:             ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[rolloverQueue[index].receiver] =
299:                 index +
300:                 1;
301:             // remove receiver from index mapping
302:             delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
303:         }
```

Which will then be updated at the end of `mintRollovers`.
```solidity
File: Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol
444: rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
445:                     rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
```

Meaning that "new" user at index `index` has inflated their shares for free (if `assetToMint` is greater than what they had previously)

## Impact
The attacker can inflate shares of another users.
Note that they do not lose any shares themselves, as they can still `withdraw()` in this new epoch.
