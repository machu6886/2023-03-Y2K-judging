# Queued deposits can be trapped by a rogue depositing contract that reverts when in the queue

## Summary
The tokens minted by the Y2K vaults, including the carousel, are of the type `ERC1155`. This type of token can be made to revert when sent to a contract. By depositing into the carousel's queue with a contract, we can cause all attempts to process deposits in the queue to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
(See the poc test below for a full example)

When `mintDepositInQueue()` is called to process the queue, it calls `_mintShares()` [on line 334](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L334-L339) to process a deposit. This mints `ERC1155` tokens using `ERC1155.mint()`. This [calls `ERC1155._doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck()`](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L285) which [checks whether the recipient is a contract](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L496-L502) and, if it is, calls `onERC1155BatchReceived()` on the recipient. If the recipient does not return `IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155BatchReceived.selector`, the transaction reverts.

It is therefore possible to have an attack contract enter into the queue and then change its behaviour to revert when the vault attempts to mint tokens to it as part of processing the queue. As the queue is FILO (first in last out), all those who entered the queue before the attack contract will be trapped behind it, unable to withdraw their funds.

Funds cannot be withdrawn for epoch 0 (queued funds) as `Carousel.withdraw()` reverts because of [its `epochHasEnded()` modifier](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L138).

An attacker could potentially wait for one or more large deposits to be placed in the queue before making this attack. As demonstrated, users who deposited into the queue before the attack contract would have their funds trapped. The attacker could potentially hold those users' funds to ransom and extract direct payment for their return.

## Impact

Users could potentially have their funds permanently locked from them, resulting in permanent loss. Or they might have to pay a ransom.

## Code Snippet
Here is a proof of concept test. Read through the comments for a description of the attack flow.

(Note: we use `forge`'s ability to send transactions direct from contracts to make the deposit process simple, but it would of course be possible to build functions in the attack contract which make it call the deposit() function on the carousel vault.)

## Recommendation

Allow users to cancel and withdraw funds for unresolved queue positions.
