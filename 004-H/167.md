# mintDepositInQueue() queue funds may be locked

## Summary
if a malicious receiver is a contract and reverts directly `onERC1155Received`, which causes `mintDepositInQueue()` revert and  the funds of the users in front of this receiver will be locked

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintDepositInQueue()` is used to execute deposit requests that are in the queue.
The code is as follows:
```solidity
    function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // make sure there is already a new epoch set
        // epoch has not started
        QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
        uint256 length = depositQueue.length;

        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();

        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();
        // relayers can always input a very big number to mint all deposit queues, without the need to read depostQueue length first
        if (_operations > length) _operations = length;

        // queue is executed from the tail to the head
        // get last index of queue
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {

            _mintShares( //<---------------If receiver is a contract, perform a revert at onERC1155Received(),will block queue
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            emit Deposit(
                msg.sender,
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }

        emit RelayerMinted(_epochId, _operations);

        asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _operations * relayerFee);
    }
```
The queue will be executed by FILO
But there is a problem here,` _mintShares()` may forever revert 
if a malicious receiver is a contract and reverts directly onERC1155Received, which causes `mintDepositInQueue()` revert and the queue to be blocked and the funds of the users in front of this receiver will be locked
Example:
depositQueue[0] = jack ,  assets=100
depositQueue[1] = bob, assets=100
depositQueue[2] = Alice , assets=1  -----> Alice is a contract and revert in onERC1155Received()
depositQueue[3].....

In this case, jack and bob's funds will be locked

****Note: `mintRollovers()` also has the same problem 
## Impact
queue funds may be locked

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Suggest adding a methods to the `factory.sol` , it can remove a certain index of depositQueue from Carousel
