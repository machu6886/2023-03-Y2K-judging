# Deposit queue and rollover queue can be DOS by a malicious user

## Summary
When ERC1155 token is minted to users, it gives control over and a malicious user can force a revert, preventing the queue from operation. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintDepositInQueue()` loops through the queue based on a first in last out basis. ERC1155 tokens are then minted to users one by one via `_mintShares()`.

ERC1155 `_mint` gives control over to user via the ERC1155TokenReceiver hook. A user may be a contract that does not implement this hook or intentionally does so and force a revert.

Because this is based on a first in last out queue, a malicious user can permanntly DOS the `mintDepositQueue`, forcing deposits in the queue to be stuck.

However, since there is a minimum required for each deposit, there is a cost to the attack.

Each attack however will make all deposits before the malicous one to be stuck.

The same vulnerablity is found in `mintRollovers`

## Impact
`mintDepositInQueue()` and `mintRollovers()` cannot be maliciously attacked and deposits before the malicious attacker's will be stuck in the queue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a try except clause and continue with the queue even if one of the deposits in the queue reverts.
