# Possible re-entrancy in safeTransferFrom() of Carousel.sol

## Summary
There is no re-entrancy guard in **safeTransferFrom()**, which triggers _safeTransferFrom() of ERC1155 which makes a callback to the recipient contract address. 
The below-mentioned function does not adhere to the check-effects-integrations principle for solidity external functions which in turn may create a pathway for cross-functional reentrancy and cross-contract reentrancy.
