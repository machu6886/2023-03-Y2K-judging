# Attacker can block deposit & rollover queue

## Summary
An attacker can block the deposit & rollover queue by reverting the call it receives from the ERC1155 token.

## Vulnerability Detail
OpenZeppelin's ERC1155 token makes a call to the recipient if it is a contract:
```sol
    function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
        require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

        address operator = _msgSender();
        uint256[] memory ids = _asSingletonArray(id);
        uint256[] memory amounts = _asSingletonArray(amount);

        _beforeTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

        _balances[id][to] += amount;
        emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);

        _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
    }

   function _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 id,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory data
    ) private {
        if (to.isContract()) {
            try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, data) returns (bytes4 response) {
                if (response != IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {
                    revert("ERC1155: ERC1155Receiver rejected tokens");
                }
            } catch Error(string memory reason) {
                revert(reason);
            } catch {
                revert("ERC1155: transfer to non-ERC1155Receiver implementer");
            }
        }
    }
```

Both the deposit & rollover queue mint shares to the recipient which would trigger that call. By entering the deposit & rollover queue with a contract that doesn't implement the ERC1155 receiver interface, the attacker can cause the relayer's tx to revert:

There's no way for deposits to be canceled. They are executed using FILO (first in last out). Meaning, any deposit made **before** the attacker's one will be locked up indefinitely the user won't be able to get back their funds.

The rollover queue does allow cancellations (`delistInRollover()`). But, everybody is only allowed to cancel their own rollover. There's no way to remove the malicious one. Rollovers are processed using FIFO. If the attacker's rollover is at index X, only rollovers from 0 to X-1 will be executable. Anyone that comes after that won't be able to use the rollover functionality.

There's also another attack vector where the attacker doesn't revert the transaction but instead consumes a large amount of gas. If the person processing the queue executes the transaction with a very large gas limit they might lose a lot of funds.

## Impact
- Deposits made before the attacker's malicious deposit will be locked up indefinitely.
- rollover functionality won't be usable by anyone listing their rollover *after* the attacker.
- possibility of gas theft by attacker (loss of funds for relayer processing either one of the queues).

## Recommendation
The call at the end of mints and transfers in ERC1155 tokens are part of the specification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#safe-transfer-rules Removing them is not really recommended.

Instead of sending the user their funds, you can set up a system where they have to claim them: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-pattern
