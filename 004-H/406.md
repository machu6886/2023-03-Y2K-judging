# ERC1155 `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck()` reentrancy callback exploits

## Summary

`Carousel.sol` have 2 reentrancy callback that need to patch.

- `_emissionBalances` update after internal `_safeTransfer` [callback from ERC1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L201-L202). There is no current exploit to manipulate emission balance, but it is still a potential risk.
- `_mintShares()` also have callback from `_mint()`. Allow only one meaningful manipulation of `mintRollovers()`, with variable `rolloverQueue` assets and epochId. Both of these value only used for viewing after the function called.

So there is no risk of user losing fund or DOS yet, but it is still a potential risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

- [Openzeppelin ERC1155 include callback](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/ca822213f2275a14c26167bd387ac3522da67fe9/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L277) for every safeTransfer call. This include `_mint()` as well.
- This allow `Carousel.sol` have reentrancy exploit [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L201) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L536). Both allow callback before changing emission balance.

- callback inside `safeTransferFrom()` allow using old `emissionBalances` for withdraw. But balance calculation revert on underflow check anyway. So there is no way to exploit this.

- Because `enlistInRollover()` and `delistInRollover()` does not have reentrancy protection. This allow exploiter to exploit `rolloverQueue[]` value.
- Which `mintRollovers()` function happen to use `_mintShares` right before updating `rolloverQueue`.
- Exploiter can update their own `rolloverQueue` value they want as long it is on top of the queue. Just call delist and then enlist with value they want. And it will [be override later during `mintRollovers()` loop.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L437-L447)
- The `rolloverQueue` at this point does not use for anything except viewing. So no risk of fund loss.

## Impact

Medium. No risk lost but can manipulate contract view function to show wrong value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Move emission code before callback.
- Add reentrancy for `enlistInRollover` and `delistInRollover` function.
