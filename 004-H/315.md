# DOS queue minting of shares

## Summary

A queue can be blocked if any of the recipient is a smart contract that reverts on  `onERC1155Received`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When minting shares, it calls an internal `_mint` function:
```solidity
 function _mintShares(
        address to,
        uint256 id,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        _mint(to, id, amount, EMPTY);
        _mintEmissions(to, id, amount);
    }
```

This function requires that if the recipient is a smart contract, it implements the `onERC1155Received`:
```solidity
    function _mint(
        address to,
        uint256 id,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory data
    ) internal virtual {
        balanceOf[to][id] += amount;

        emit TransferSingle(msg.sender, address(0), to, id, amount);

        require(
            to.code.length == 0
                ? to != address(0)
                : ERC1155TokenReceiver(to).onERC1155Received(msg.sender, address(0), id, amount, data) ==
                    ERC1155TokenReceiver.onERC1155Received.selector,
            "UNSAFE_RECIPIENT"
        );
    }
```

The `_mintShares` function is utilized in `_deposit`, `mintDepositInQueue`, and `mintRollovers`. The problem is that the latter 2 functions execute the minting in a loop, e.g.:
```solidity
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            emit Deposit(
                msg.sender,
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            depositQueue.pop();
```
A malicious actor can write a custom recipient smart contract that does not revert on deposit but reverts when queue actions are executed. This way it will block the queue which is implemented in a FILO principle.

## Impact

Anyone can block the queue with a custom smart contract that reverts.

## Recommendation

There are many options, for example, allowing to skip certain items, performing the operation in a try/catch, or overriding the mint function to skip this check.
