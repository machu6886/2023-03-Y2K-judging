# DOS `_mintShare()` using Openzeppelin ERC1155 `_mint` callback

## Summary

The ERC1155 function `_mint()` implemented by Openzeppelin have `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck()` [callback after minting new token.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/ca822213f2275a14c26167bd387ac3522da67fe9/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L277)

`Carousel.sol` allow mint vault share or ERC1155 token at later date by Relayer user/contract.
Relayer execute all deposit/mint one by one in a queue. If any queue failed, relayer cannot skip it.
There are many user input check to prevent this but not for internal `_mintShare()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Call `deposit()` with any contract address as receiver address.
- Anyone can set `_mintShare()` receiver address to any contract that **not** implementing `onERC1155Received` callback function.
- `_mintShare()` use internal `_mint()` function from Openzeppelin ERC1155 contract.
- ERC1155 have `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck()` callback to receiver address after minting new token.
- Both function `mintDepositInQueue()`, `mintRollovers()` use by relayer will be reverted due to `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck()` callback revert.
- This block all queue from being used as relayer cannot skip failed queue.

## Impact

High. Permanently lock all user funds in `depositQueue` or auto rollover feature. There is no withdrawal method for user in epoch 0 or "queue epoch".

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Dirty fix try-catch and throw error into failed queueItem array. Include new withdrawal for failed queue.
