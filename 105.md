# Incorrect chainlink price staleness check could prevent a depeg trigger

## Summary

Incorrect check for stale prices could lead to an outdated price. The `triggerDepeg()` function relies on accurate price to work as expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

To check for staleness, the function `getLastestPrice()` added the following: `if (answeredInRound < roundID) revert RoundIDOutdated();`. Using the `answeredInRound` value was recommended in the past for these types of checks. However, this parameter is now deprecated. This can be verified by examining the `OffchainAggregator.sol` contract, specifically at line 1791 where the `latestRoundData()` function is defined. Here, you will notice that `answeredInRound` is always equal to `roundId`.

## Impact

Outdated price could prevent the ``triggerDepeg()`` function from been executed, breaking core protocol assumptions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the returned value `updatedAt` in combination with `block.timestamp` and a `TIMEOUT` variable to check for staleness.

```solidity
if (block.timestamp - updatedAt > TIMEOUT) {
    revert();
}
```
