# Increase in `relayerFee` may leads to failure of `mintDepositInQueue` method

## Summary
Users can deposit the assets in the queue of the Carousel vault . These assets can be minted for future epochId by calling `mintDepositInQueue`.  This is a public method and anyone who calls this method gets paid the `relayerFee`.  Technically it is possible to increase the  `relayerFee`  after the deposit queue has been created.  If the new `relayerFee` is  greater than any of the deposit amounts in the queue then `mintDepositInQueue` will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `mintDepositInQueue` method is called then the caller gets `relayerFee` from each depositor's asset amount. When users initially deposited in the queue they get shares after subtracting `relayerFee`. If relayerFee is increased to an amount higher than any of the amount of queue then below logic will fail because of subtraction underflow error.
```solidity
 while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // This loop implements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,  // FIXME: all fund going to one epoch
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
   .....
}
```

## Impact
`mintDepositInQueue` fails

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are multiple possible options that can be considered but each has its own pros/cons.  Some of these are
- Consider storing the current `relayerFee` in a queue struct along with deposit data so that changes in fee do not impact the users who have already deposited considering current `relayerFee`.
- Do not allow a fee change if the queue is not empty.
- Do not allow a fee change if the new fee is higher than any deposit amount in the queue. Scan the queue and validate it.
