## Summary
The rollover queue is designed to keep tracking queues, in the way that if the user has already queued up a rollover. `enlistInRollover()` will just update the queue for the user. To minimize the length of `rolloverQueue[ ]`

## Vulnerability Detail
In case Bob has already queued up a rollover 
Let's say: `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[address(Bob)] == X`
and `rolloverAccounting[epoch Y] == X+n`
epoch Y exists and has not started yet

Bob will invoke [enlistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238-L271) this logic will execute 

```solidity
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        }
```
Now Bob thinks he will be in epoch Y But unfortunately, this will never happen
in this way, he could be only in the next epoch Y+1

Bob needs to first call `enlistInRollover()`
