# Uses funds could get locked in Carousel

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Users invoke `depositETH()`/`deposit()` with `_id ==0`. so [_deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L494-L500) will queue up their deposit for the next available epoch 

In case the owner decides to stop creating a new epoch in a specific market.
The users won't be able to withdraw their funds from `epoch 0` ( depositQueue[ ] )

## Impact
Uses funds could get locked in `Carousel.sol`
