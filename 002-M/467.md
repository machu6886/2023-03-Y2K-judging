# Null epoch stakers can't rollover

## Summary

mintRollovers() checks rollover eligibility with `entitledShares > queue[index].assets` among other conditions.

This rules out null Vaults depositors who wants and can roll over as they all have `entitledShares == queue[index].assets` (supposing no precision was lost in previewWithdraw() for them). Such rollovers are fully valid and there is no reason to make it unavailable for such users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The check can be loosened even further (say lost users who still have enough funds can be rolled over), but anyway users who has a draw definitely constitute a valid case for rollover. Say rarely it can even be `entitledShares == queue[index].assets` in a normal, not null, epoch, when user has won (premium equals collateral after the fees and it was a depeg).

As such null epoch users have no preliminary warning of unavailability of rollover for them, it can result in a loss as a user relied on rollover instead of doing manual withdraw-deposit, rollover didn't happened and the user has lost their position, while it might be a hedge for a much bigger one.

## Impact

Absence of position when user enlisted in a rollover having ample funds available from a null epoch can result in a loss for them as the position can be a part of bigger picture and functionality unavailability in this case looks to be more a technical oversight than a valid limitation, i.e. users will not expect that rollover from a null epoch be denied.

## Code Snippet

mintRollovers() proceeds with a user only when payout is strictly bigger than the initial investment:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L401

```solidity
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
```

For null epoch previewWithdraw() will return value close to `_assets` as `claimTVL == finalTVL`:

```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
        public
        view
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
    {
        // entitledAmount amount is derived from the claimTVL and the finalTVL
        // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% lower than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 500 assets
        // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% higher than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 1500 assets
        entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Consider treating null epoch and equality as a valid cases for rollover:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L396-401

```diff
-               uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw( queue[index].epochId, queue[index].assets);
+               uint256 entitledShares = epochNull[queue[index].epochId] ? queue[index].assets : previewWithdraw( queue[index].epochId, queue[index].assets);
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
-               if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
+               if (entitledShares >= queue[index].assets) {
```
