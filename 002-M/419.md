# Null epoch prevents carousel rollover

## Summary

Carousel deposits in epochs that result in a null epoch (premium or collateral vault has zero TVL) will not be rolled over and require manual re-enlistment.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Carousel.mintRollovers` function iterates over all queued rollover items and checks the entitled shares for the current item and the epoch. If the entitled shares (`entitledShares`) are greater than the deposited assets (`queue[index].assets`), the user is considered to have "won" the epoch, and the rollover is minted.

However, the definition of "winning" an epoch does not necessarily mean that the entitled shares are larger than the deposit.

If the epoch was a null epoch, the vault which had a non-zero TVL can claim its own TVL. This means that the entitled shares are equal to `queue[index].assets`. Causing the item not to be rolled over.

## Impact

In the case of a null epoch, the carousel will not roll over affected queue items, and users are forced to manually enlist again to be part of the next epoch.

```solidity
361: function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)

364:     epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
365:     nonReentrant
366: {

392:
393:     while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
394:         // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
395:         if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
396:             uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
397:                 queue[index].epochId,
398:                 queue[index].assets
399:             );
400:             // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
401: @>          if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
402:                 // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
403:                 if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
404:                     index++;
405:                     continue;
406:                 }

## Recommendation

Consider rolling over if the entitled shares are greater than `0`.
