# Unbounded loop causes dos and relayers cannot be compensated

## Summary
Unbounded loop causes dos and relayers cannot be compensated
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Carousel.sol` contract there is unbounded loop in the `mintRollovers` function. we can see this unbounded loop in the snippet below.
```solidity
        while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
            if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
                uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
                    queue[index].epochId,
                    queue[index].assets
                );
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
                    if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }
                    // @note we know shares were locked up to this point
                    _burn(
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        queue[index].epochId,
                        queue[index].assets
                    );
                    // transfer emission tokens out of contract otherwise user could not access them as vault shares are burned
                    _burnEmissions(
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        queue[index].epochId,
                        queue[index].assets
                    );
                    // @note emission token is a known token which has no before transfer hooks which makes transfer safer
                    emissionsToken.safeTransfer(
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        previewEmissionsWithdraw(
                            queue[index].epochId,
                            queue[index].assets
                        )
                    );

                    emit Withdraw(
                        msg.sender,
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        _epochId,
                        queue[index].assets,
                        entitledShares
                    );
                    uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;
                    _mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint);
                    emit Deposit(
                        msg.sender,
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        _epochId,
                        assetsToMint
                    );
                    rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
                    rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
                    // only pay relayer for successful mints
                    executions++;
                }
            }
            index++;
        }
```
because the amount can be infinitely large, the loop may run out of gas and this in turn will cause a dos for the protocol. The relayers will be failed to be compensated because of this denial of service.

 only when the roll over request win in the epoch round, the execution is incremented and the relayer is compensated with the relayer fee, but it is possible there is a large number of queued request that does not win the epoch, the relayer still pay the gas fee to process fee and get no compensation. this is seen in the snippet below.
```solidity
 queue[index].epochId,
                    queue[index].assets
                );
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
                    if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }
```
## Impact
Unbounded loop can cause a denial of service in the protocol. Relayers cannot be paid and functions do not work properly. Direct loss of funds for the relayers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 still send at least a part of the relayer fee to relayer and also limit the unbounded loop to avoid running out of gas error.
