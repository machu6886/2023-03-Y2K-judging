# enlistInRollover updates ownerToRollOverQueueIndex incorrectly

## Summary
enlistInRollover updates ownerToRollOverQueueIndex incorrectly. 

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268
enlistInRollover updates ownerToRollOverQueueIndex to point to last element of the rolloverQueue in all cases. But this is only correct when the user's entry was just pushed onto the queue.

In other words, this update should only happen in the else block.

## Impact
The user's ownerToRollOverQueueIndex now points to someone else's asset & epoch information. This breaks a lot of assumptions, so there should be many ways to exploit this.

One possible exploit is to use this to withdraw funds which should otherwise be locked in the rollover. Suppose the user deposited assets in some epoch x, locked all of them in the rollover, and sees the entry at the end of the rollover queue has a different epoch y. The user can call enlistInRollover again (with the same arguments) to point their ownerToRollOverQueueIndex to the end of the queue.

They can now bypass the check in notRollingOver and withdraw their underlying assets which should've been locked.

Now, the rollover function will fail when it attempts to burn the user's tokens since they've already been burned when the user called withdraw. This causes permanent DOS the rollover system.

Another possible exploit is to increase the fund locked in the rollover for the actual owner of the entry.

Move this line into the else block
