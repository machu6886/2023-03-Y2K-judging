# Epoch is wrongly settled if sequencer is down

## Summary
Epoch is wrongly settled if sequencer is down
## Vulnerability Detail
 `triggerDepeg` is called to when a depeg has happened. This function calls the `getLatestPrice` function. The problem begins when the arbitrum sequencer is down. If the sequencer is down then calling the function `getLatestPrice` will revert until the sequencer is back up.
 
 Now let us assume the epoch ends in 10,000 seconds. If the sequencer goes down and the asset depegs. There is no way for `triggerDepeg` to be called. 
 
 The sequencer comes back on at second 9500 after asset repegs. This means that the epoch will be wrongly settled because a depeg happened but the function `triggerDepeg` could not be called due to the sequencer being down.
 
 The user who bought insurance was never protected and the protocol did not function as intended. 
 
 you can observe the snippet of code that contains the logic below.
 
 ```solidity
     function triggerDepeg(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _epochId) public {
        address[2] memory vaults = vaultFactory.getVaults(_marketId);

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0))
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);

        IVaultV2 premiumVault = IVaultV2(vaults[0]);
        IVaultV2 collateralVault = IVaultV2(vaults[1]);

        if (premiumVault.epochExists(_epochId) == false) revert EpochNotExist();

        int256 price = getLatestPrice(premiumVault.token());

        if (int256(premiumVault.strike()) <= price)
            revert PriceNotAtStrikePrice(price);

        (uint40 epochStart, uint40 epochEnd, ) = premiumVault.getEpochConfig(
            _epochId
        );

        if (uint256(epochStart) > block.timestamp) revert EpochNotStarted();

        if (block.timestamp > uint256(epochEnd)) revert EpochExpired();

        //require this function cannot be called twice in the same epoch for the same vault
        if (premiumVault.epochResolved(_epochId)) revert EpochFinishedAlready();
        if (collateralVault.epochResolved(_epochId))
            revert EpochFinishedAlready();

        // check if epoch qualifies for null epoch
        if (
            premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0 ||
            collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0
        ) {
            revert VaultZeroTVL();
        }

        premiumVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
        collateralVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);

        uint256 epochFee = vaultFactory.getEpochFee(_epochId);

        uint256 premiumTVL = premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId);
        uint256 collateralTVL = collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId);

        uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);
        uint256 collateralFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(
            collateralTVL,
            epochFee
        );

        // avoid stack too deep error by avoiding local variables
        // uint256 premiumTVLAfterFee = premiumTVL - premiumFee;
        // uint256 collateralTVLAfterFee = collateralTVL - collateralFee;

        premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, collateralTVL - collateralFee);
        collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, premiumTVL - premiumFee);

        // send fees to treasury and remaining TVL to respective counterparty vault
        // strike price reached so premium is entitled to collateralTVL - collateralFee
        premiumVault.sendTokens(_epochId, premiumFee, treasury);
        premiumVault.sendTokens(
            _epochId,
            premiumTVL - premiumFee,
            address(collateralVault)
        );
        // strike price is reached so collateral is still entitled to premiumTVL - premiumFee but looses collateralTVL
        collateralVault.sendTokens(_epochId, collateralFee, treasury);
        collateralVault.sendTokens(
            _epochId,
            collateralTVL - collateralFee,
            address(premiumVault)
        );
 ```

## Impact
The impact of the sequencer being down is that epochs can be wrongly settled. User who bought insurance were never covered by the collateral vault. The entire functionality of the protocol is now useless if the sequencer is down. Essentially the user is not protected, when this was the entire purpose of the protocol.
