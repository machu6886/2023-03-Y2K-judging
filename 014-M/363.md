# [MED] If it depegged towards the end of the epoch, triggerDepeg cannot be called.

## Summary
getLatestPrice() fetches the latest data from sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData(), which has a grace period of 3600. If the value of startedAt returned by latestRoundData() is less than 3600 before the end of the epoch, triggerDepeg() cannot be called even though it is depegged.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink's feed is updated once every 1 to 24 hours and can be found at the link below.

[https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet](https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet)

The problem is that if the following scenario occurs, the user will not be able to get rewarded for depegging even though the coin have been depegged. Let's assume the current block.timestamp is 10000, and the Epoch ends at 13000.

1. DataFeed updates at 10000, alert depegging happened
2. Since EpochEnd time - DataFeed time < 3600, user never able to triggerDepeg().
3. After Epoch ends at 13000, another user in the risk vault calls triggerEndEpoch().
4. Users in the counter vault will gain an unfair advantage.

In this situation, the Depositor may not be guaranteed his/her rights, and may not be compensated even if a depeg occurs.

## Impact
Even though depeg happened, collateral vault user will not correctly insured

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recomand to make 1 day delay after epoch end to make verify depegging event. This can be done by using `.getRoundData(roundId)` instead of using `latestRoundData()`.

You may check startAt variable, which is returned from `.getRoundData(roundId)`, is between epochStart and epochEnd.
