# Carousel: DOS in `getRolloverTVL` and `getDepositQueueTVL` function

## Summary
The `Carousel.getRolloverTVL` function iterates over all elements in the `rolloverQueue` to calculate the TVL.
The `Carousel.getDepositQueueTVL` function does the same for the `depositQueue`.

The issue with both functions is that the `rolloverQueue` / `depositQueue` can contain so many elements that the block gas limit is reached and the function always reverts no matter how much Gas is provided.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is more severe for the `getRolloverTVL` function because elements from the rollover queue can only be removed by the user.
So an attacker can put a lot of entries into the rollover queue with different addresses such that the function cannot be provided with sufficient Gas to iterate over all elements or the function call becomes very expensive. Only he himself can remove these entries.

The `depositQueue` is different because entries are removed when they are processed.

## Impact
An attacker can DOS the `getRolloverTVL` and `getDepositQueueTVL` functions such that other protocols cannot integrate with them or make calls to them very expensive which is a loss of funds for users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This problem is hard to solve because it is intended that elements in the `rolloverQueue` remain in the queue after they are processed for the next rollover.

A solution can be to make the functions paginated such that not all elements must be queried at once which solves the DOS attack.
