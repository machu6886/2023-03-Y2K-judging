# Carousel.mintDepositInQueue might stuck user's funds when relayerFee increased

## Summary
When **Carousel.changeRelayerFee** is called to increase __relayerFee__ larger than current relayerFee,   an adversary can frontrun Carousel.changeRelayerFee to block users who are already in depositQueue until changeRelayerFee changes back( or smaller).

Since there is no way to withdraw the funds unless changeRelayerFee is changing back, users' funds got stucked.
## Vulnerability Detail
In function [Carousel.mintDepositInQueue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L337)

            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee /// might revert here
            );

if **queue[i].assets** is less than **relayerFee**, function __Carousel.mintDepositInQueue__ will revert.

So 
1) Supposed that current relayerFee is 500
2) when **Carousel.changeRelayerFee** is called to __increase relayerFee to 1000__ , an adversary can front run **Carousel.changeRelayerFee** by calling **Carousel.deposit** with **__id** = 0, **_assets** = 500(which is current relayerFee),  then the adversary's deposit is pushed into depositQueue.
3) After that, **Carousel.changeRelayerFee** is called, and __relayerFee__ is updated to 1000.
4) When a relayer tries to call Carousel.mintDepositInQueue, because **queue[i].assets(adversary's deposit assets which is 500)** is less than **relayerFee(which is 1000)**, function __Carousel.mintDepositInQueue__ will revert
5) Since  Carousel.mintDepositInQueue is [looped in FILO (first in last out) order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L333), all deposits before adversary's deposits won't be able to **_mintShares**
6) the only way to recuse the funds is to decrease __relayerFee__
