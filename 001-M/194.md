# `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue()` will revert if `relayerFee` was increased.

## Summary
While deposits in the rollover queue are minted, it uses the current `relayerFee` and it might revert if `relayerFee` was increased recently.

## Vulnerability Detail
`deposit()` checks if the deposit amount is greater than `relayerFee` using the `minRequiredDeposit` modifier.

And `mintDepositInQueue()` deducts `relayerFee` during minting.

```solidity
File: Carousel.mintDepositInQueue()
331:         while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
332:             // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
333:             // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
334:             _mintShares(
335:                 queue[i].receiver,
336:                 _epochId,
337:                 queue[i].assets - relayerFee //@audit revert
338:             );
339:             emit Deposit(
340:                 msg.sender,
341:                 queue[i].receiver,
342:                 _epochId,
343:                 queue[i].assets - relayerFee //@audit revert
344:             );
345:             depositQueue.pop();
346:             if (i == 0) break;
347:             unchecked {
348:                 i--;
349:             }
350:         }
```

But `relayerFee` can be changed by the factory anytime and the new `relayerFee` might be greater than the old deposit amount inside the rollover queue.

In this case, `mintDepositInQueue()` will revert until `relayerFee` is decreased again.

- At the first time, `relayerFee = 10000`.
- After that, the admin started a proposal to set `relayerFee = 20000` using the timelock.
- Right before the proposal is executed, a user enlisted a deposit of 10000 amount.
- After `relayerFee` is updated to `20000`, `mintDepositInQueue()` will revert due to underflow.

## Impact
The queued deposits would be minted after the `relayerFee` is increased.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should track `relayerFee` when deposits are enlisted and use that amount without using the current fee.
