# Admin can lock or steal the funds In depositQueue by setting manipulating relayerFee

## Summary
Admin can lock the entire funds in the depositQueue by chaging the relayerFee to arbitrarily large value or he can set relayerFee to a carefully chosen value to steal maximum funds from the depositQueue.

## Vulnerability Detail

An admin can call the `CarouselFactory.changeRelayerFee`  function to manipulate the relayerFee to lock or steal the funds of users in depositQueue. Eventhough `CarouselFactory.changeRelayerFee` is a timelocked function the users in depositQueue can't do anything to take their funds back from depositQueue as their isn't a way for users to take off their funds from depositQueue once deposited.Funds can be only moved to epoch from depositQueue to epoch only after an epoch is created, which is again in the hands of Admin.

**Attack scenario 1:**

1. Users deposit funds to the depositQueue as there is no epoch in deposit window.
2. Now admin will call the `CarouselFactory.changeRelayerFee` using time lock contract with 3 days delay to set the `relayerFee` to an arbitrarily large value.
3. User's notice this timelocked transaction but can't do anything as they can't take off their funds from deposit Queue.
4. After 3 days passed the relayerFee will be set to an arbitrarily large value.
5. Now relayers can't rollover the deposits in depositQueue to epoch because the fee subtraction in the `Carousel.mintDepositInQueue` will overflow for rollovers.
    ```solidity
    _mintShares(
             queue[i].receiver,
             _epochId,
             queue[i].assets - relayerFee
    );
    ```

**Attack scenario 2:**
1. Users deposit funds to the depositQueue as there is no epoch in deposit window.
2. Now admin will call the `CarouselFactory.changeRelayerFee` using time lock contract with 3 days delay to set the `relayerFee` to a carefully chosen which allows him to steal maximum amount of funds in queue.
3. User's notice this timelocked transaction but can't do anything as they can't take off their funds from deposit Queue.
4. After 3 days passed the relayerFee will be set to an chosen value.  
5. At this point eventough relayerFee is set to chosen value no other relayer can steal the funds as their isn't any epoch created yet.
6. Now admin sends epoch creation transaction and funds stealing transaction as internal transactions of a transaction as admin is most likely a multsig contract which might have a batchTransactions feature.
7. This way admin can steal the funds of the users in deposit Queue.
8. Admin call even carefully chose the duration to a very small value to ensure that only his rollover transaction will execute and epoch expires again.
9. This way admin can steal all the funds in queue by following this process multiple times.

## Impact
All the user in deposit Queue will loose their funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
       // ...
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );

            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }

        emit RelayerMinted(_epochId, _operations);

        asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _operations * relayerFee);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The vulnerability can be addressed by fixing the relayerFee at the time of depositing to the depositQueue, which would prevent the admin from manipulating the relayerFee later on.
- Add relayerFee field to Queue object.
    ```solidity
    struct QueueItem {
          uint256 assets;
          address receiver;
          uint256 epochId;
      +   uint256 relayerFee;
    }
    ```
- Modify the `_deposit` function to fix the relayerFee at deposit time.
```solidity
function _deposit(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
    ) internal {
        // mint logic, either in queue or direct deposit
        if (_id != 0) {
            uint256 assetsToDeposit = _assets;

            if (depositFee > 0) {
                (uint256 maxX, , uint256 minX) = getEpochConfig(_id);
                // deposit fee is calcualted linearly between time of epoch creation and epoch starting (deposit window)
                // this is because late depositors have an informational advantage
                uint256 fee = _calculateFeePercent(int256(minX), int256(maxX));
                // min minRequiredDeposit modifier ensures that _assets has high enough value to not devide by 0
                // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
                uint256 feeAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
                assetsToDeposit = _assets - feeAmount;
                _asset().safeTransfer(treasury, feeAmount);
            }

            _mintShares(_receiver, _id, assetsToDeposit);

            emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
        } else {
            depositQueue.push(
        -      QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id})
        +      QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id, relayerFee: relayerFee})
            );

            emit DepositInQueue(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
        }
}
```
