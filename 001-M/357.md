# change of the relayer fee can block minDepositInQueue

## Summary
change of the relayer fee can block minDepositInQueue
## Vulnerability Detail
let us observe the snippet below.
```solidity
 // queue is executed from the tail to the head
        // get last index of queue
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            emit Deposit(
                msg.sender,
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }
```
also in this snippet the users deposit request is added to the queue.
```solidity
        // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
```
additionally below is a snippet of code where the timelocker contract can change the relayer fee in the `CarouselFactory.sol` contract
```solidity
  /** @notice Function to change the relayer fee
    @param _relayerFee uint256 of the relayer fee
    @param _marketIndex uint256 of the market index
     */
    function changeRelayerFee(uint256 _relayerFee, uint256 _marketIndex)
        public
        onlyTimeLocker
    {
        if (_relayerFee < 10000) revert InvalidRelayerFee();

        address[2] memory vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketIndex];
        if (vaults[0] == address(0)) revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketIndex);
        ICarousel insr = ICarousel(vaults[0]);
        ICarousel risk = ICarousel(vaults[1]);
        insr.changeRelayerFee(_relayerFee);
        risk.changeRelayerFee(_relayerFee);

        emit ChangedRelayerFee(_relayerFee, _marketIndex);
    }
```
as we can see the user can specify the amount of asset he want. i will show a proof of concept below on why this is an issue and how a user can use this function to DOS the mintDepositInQueue function.
- user puts a deposit request for 1,5 usdc in deposit queue
- relayer fee is currently 1 usdc
- relayer fee is now changed to 2 usdc
- then queue[i].assets - relayerFee would revert in arithmetic underflow
- 1.5-2 would cause revert
- this problematic deposit would cause the function to revert, and since queue is last in first out. if this deposit is last in the queue every single deposit that came before will be stuck
## Impact
The change in the relayer fee could cause a dos in the mintDepositInqueue function. Every single deposit that came before the last one would not be able to mint

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend checks are added as to where raising the relayer fee does not exceed the lowest deposit amount.
