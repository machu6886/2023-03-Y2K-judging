# increasing realyerFee can lock all assets in depositQue (Carousel)

## Summary
`Carousel.mintDepositInQueue()` does not check if assets>relayerFee and can revert because of underflow if relayerFee has been increased. 
> _mintShares(queue[i].receiver,  _epochId, **queue[i].assets - relayerFee**);_

If one item in the deposit queue reverts, the subsequent items will also be unable to be minted.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. consider relayerFee = 10000
2. Attacker/user deposits _assets = 10000 to epoch 0, which meets minRequiredDeposit. 
3. assets are added to depositQue
4. Timelocker increases the relayerFee to 10001
5. mintsDepositInQue reverts when trying to mint the above assets, because of underflow of `assets-relayerFee = -1`
```solidity
_mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
```


## Impact
Increasing relayerFee can lock assets in depositQue

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
skip the queue item if the assets cannot cover the relayerFee instead of revert.
This check is done in mintRollover:
```solidity
// mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over 
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
                    if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }
```
