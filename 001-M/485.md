# Increasing relayer fee could break minting of deposits

## Summary

If the relayer fee is increased, the function to mint deposits could be broken due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `mintDepositInQueue` calculates the amount of shares to mint as difference of assets and relayerFee:

```js
_mintShares(
    queue[i].receiver,
    _epochId,
    queue[i].assets - relayerFee
);
```

When the queue item is inserted it is asserted through the `minRequiredDeposit` modifier that `queue[i].assets` is at least equal to the relayer fee. However, if the relayer fee is increased, this invariant can be broken. An attacker would be able to frontrun the relayer fee increase with the insert of an item that only covers the old fee. This would cause the  `mintDepositInQueue` to revert and all unprocessed items that are still in queue before the malicious item to not be processable.

## Impact

Harm to users, break of functionality.

## Recommendation
Check that `queue[i].assets >= relayerFee` and pop if not
