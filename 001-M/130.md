# RelayerFee Update Traps Deposits in Queue

## Summary
If the Timelocker updates the relayerFee when a depositor in the depositQueue has a deposit amount smaller than the relayerFee, both that user and those preceding them in the array queue will be unable to retrieve their deposits due to an underflow occurring during the fee deduction process.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the depositQueue at a given time, with the relayerFee set at 1 * 1e18:

[(100 * 1e18 tokens, Alice, 0), (100 * 1e18 tokens, Bob, 0), (1.5 * 1e18 tokens, Carol, 0)]

Now, assume the Timelocker sets the relayerFee to 2 * 1e18. At this point, the mintDepositQueue function will fail because Carol's tokens are not greater than the new relayerFee amount. Since the minting process of the queue starts from the latest index, and Carol is at that position, Alice and Bob's 100 * 1e18 tokens will also be stuck, as the loop will not finish due to Carol's index causing the entire process to revert.

As there is no alternative way for users to exit the depositQueue except for the successful completion of the minting process, the funds belonging to Alice and Bob will be stuck indefinitely.

this line will revert due to underflow https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L334-L337

and the loop will revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure that the depositQueue is fully empty before calling the setRelayFee function. Since it is currently only callable via time lock, some malicious user would deposit the old relayFee amount + 1 tokens just to break the whole system. It might be good to carry out this functionality to admin EOA to make things faster and clearer.
