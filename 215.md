# No check for zero TVL of either vault in triggerEndEpoch() leading to permanent freezing of funds

## Summary
When **triggerEndEpoch()** of **ControllerPeggedAssetV2** is called, there is no check for zero TVL of either vault before resolving the epoch and transferring the funds to **counterpartyVault**

## Vulnerability Detail
**Where**: [ControllerPeggedAssetV2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L144-L202)

Consider, 
- There is no depositor in collateralVault till beginEpoch time, So collateral TVL = 0.
- There are depositors in premiumVault, so premium TVL > 0
- No one has called **triggerNullEpoch()** till Epoch ends.
- Now if someone calls **triggerEndEpoch()**
  - Epoch will be resolved
  - Funds from the premium vault will be transferred to the collateral vault but there is no collateral user to claim it. So, the funds are locked for this epoch in the collateral vault
  - Ideally, in such a scenario, premium vault users should have been able to claim their premium back (as it happens in triggerNullEpoch).
 
**Note:** We think in such scenarios, it is a huge liability for protocol and users to ensure calling **triggerNullEpoch()** before the trigger ends.
 
## Impact
- Permanent freezing of funds in the collateral vault, which is a loss for premium vault user

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Check if epoch qualifies for null epoch in **triggerEndEpoch()**
