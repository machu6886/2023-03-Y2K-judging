# User cannot roll over all of their assets

## Summary
Users who are unaware of this bug may enlist the rollover of their entire asset to next epoch, only to find out that mintRollovers skips executing the operation since the “entitledShares == queue[index].assets”  

## Vulnerability Detail
enlistInRollover does not prevent user from enlisting full amount of balance to another epochId, as it only check:
```solidity
        if (balanceOf(_receiver, _epochId) < _assets)  // @audit the other _epochId?
            revert InsufficientBalance();
```
Yet, in mintRollOver, ‘==‘ will be skipped.  

## Impact
When such cases happen, the user has to explicitly delistInRollover and re-deposit for next epoch, costing gas and opportunity.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
   …
}
```
