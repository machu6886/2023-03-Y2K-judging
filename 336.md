# [M-1] Treasury address could not be changed

## Summary

The `changeTreasury` function in VaultFactoryV2 is faulty and does not allow the timelock contract to update the treasury address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury` has a bug that prevents updating the `treasury` state variable. The bug is caused by passing the wrong argument to the setTreasury function. Instead of passing `_treasury`, which is the new address to be set, it passes `treasury`, which is the current address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L242-L243

```javascript
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);
```

It results in the `treasury` state variable is not changed.

## Impact

The VaultFactoryV2 has a critical flaw that prevents changing the treasury address. This means that if the treasury address is hacked or lost, there is no alternative way to update the treasury address.
