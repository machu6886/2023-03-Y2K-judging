# If withdrawal fee is set incorrectly, it will cause a temporary DoS on the triggerDepeg and triggerEndEpoch functions

## Summary

A withdrawal fee is set when creating a new epoch. This fee is used on the `triggerDepeg()` and `triggerEndEpoch()` functions from the `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol` contract to calculate the amount to be deducted from `finalTVL` and that is sent to the `treasury`. If the value is set to a number greater than 10,000 then it will DoSed the functions mentioned above.

## Vulnerability Detail

When creating an epoch, either with emissions or not, a `_withdrawalFee` parameter is passed. This parameter end up stored on the storage of the contract on the `_setEpoch()` function:

`epochFee[_epochConfig.epochId] = _epochConfig.withdrawalFee;`

This value is read during the the `triggerDepeg()` and `triggerEndEpoch()` functions to calculate the amount to be deducted from the finalTVL of the premium or collateral vault.

From `triggerDepeg()`:

```solidity
uint256 epochFee = vaultFactory.getEpochFee(_epochId);

uint256 premiumTVL = premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId);
uint256 collateralTVL = collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId);

uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);
uint256 collateralFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(collateralTVL, epochFee);

premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, collateralTVL - collateralFee);
collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, premiumTVL - premiumFee);
```

From `triggerEndEpoch()`:

```solidity
uint256 epochFee = vaultFactory.getEpochFee(_epochId);

uint256 premiumTVL = premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId);
uint256 collateralTVL = collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId);

uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);

uint256 premiumTVLAfterFee = premiumTVL - premiumFee;
```
The fee is calculated as follows:

```solidity
function calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(uint256 amount, uint256 fee)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 feeValue)
    {
        // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
        return amount.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
    }
```
## Impact

From above, we know that the fee must be on basis points (10_000 for 100% and so on). If the fee is above 10_000 then the result will be greater than the `amount` used as an argument. In the case of  `triggerDepeg()` and `triggerEndEpoch()` means that the fee to be deducted will be greater than the finalTVLs causing a revert due to underflow. Unfortunately, there is no way to change the `withdrawalFee` that was set.

Fortunately, the funds are not lost since the controller can be changed for one that does not consider the fee. However, the function `triggerDepeg()` is highly time sensitive (and the timelocker's minDelay is 3 days), so this potentially mistake can prevent the execution of `triggerDepeg()` during a depeg event, breaking core functionality of the protocol.

## Recommendation

Avoid any mistake that can be done regarding the value of the `withdrawalFee` by adding a check during the creation of an epoch

`if (_withdrawalFee == 0 || _withdrawalFee > 10_000) revert InvalidFee();`
