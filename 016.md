# No checks for `epochBegin` and `epochEnd` time frame in `VaultV2.sol`.

## Summary
No checks for `epochBegin` and `epochEnd` time frame.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `VaultV2.sol`'s `setEpoch()` function, there are no checks to validate that `epochBegin` or `epochEnd` is set to a past time by the factory. Also, the factory doesn't make this check either in its `createEpoch()` and `_setEpoch()` functions. This can lead to times being set to the past or far ahead into the future.
Epochs set far ahead into the future cannot be resolved as they will fail the `epochHasStarted()` modifier, locking up deposited funds because `withdraw()` requires epoch to be resolved.

None.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. There should be a range of time in the future where by epochs cannot be set.
2. Epochs cannot start at a time < block.timestamp.
