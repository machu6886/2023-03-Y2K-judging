# changing an existing rollover updates the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` wrong

## Summary
When updating an existing rollover the index for the user is erroneously set to the last element in the queue.

## Vulnerability Detail
When enlisting in rollover, if a user already have an existing rollover they will update their old rollover otherwise they will get put last in queue:

The issue is that even if the user is just updating an existing rollover they will have their index updated, since the index is always written as `rolloverQueue.length`:

Imagine Alice and Bob both have enlisted in rollovers:
`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex`:
| user  | index |
| ----- | ----- |
| Alice | 1     |
| Bob   | 2     |

`rolloverQueue`:
| index | receiver |
| ----- | -------- |
|  0    | Alice    |
|  1    | Bob      |

Alice enlists again, don't need to change anything:

`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex`:
| user  | index            |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Alice | 2 `queue.length` | 
| Bob   | 2                |

`rolloverQueue`:
| index | receiver |
| ----- | -------- |
|  0    | Alice    |
|  1    | Bob      |

Now Alice index points at Bobs item.

### Alice updates again
She can now increase the amount Bob should rollover either more than what he has to DoS the minting of rollovers or more than what he wants (as long as she has assets enough). 

### Alice delists:
`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex`:
| user  | index |
| ----- | ----- |
| Bob   | 2     |

`rolloverQueue`:
| index | receiver |
| ----- | -------- |
|  0    | Alice    |

Now Alice can choose to withdraw (once epoch is resolved) which would DoS the rollover queue as there are no shares to burn.
Bobs rollover has been denied completely as well, as it was that one that got popped from the delist.

## Impact
This causes multiple ways to DoS the minting of rollovers. It can deny rollovers from users or change the amount they roll over. Ths cost of this attack is only `relayerFee + 1` since all you need is a deposit.

Because of the general havoc this can cause, I'm categorizing this as high.

## Recommendation
Move the index update into the `else` so it's only done when adding a new item:
