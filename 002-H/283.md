# Incorrect logic in function `enlistInRollover()` in case user has already queued up a rollover

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253-L268

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `enlistInRollover()` is used to enlist in rollover queue. In case user has already queued up for a rollover before, it will update the queue entry at index instead of adding a new entry at the end of the queue. 

However, the logic is wrong, it always set the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[]` to the length of queue even when it did not pushing new entry at the end.
```solidity
// @audit incorrect in case user has already queued up a rollover
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```

## Impact
Attacker can abuse this to manipulate value of the next user who call `enlistInRollover()`. 
Since the index of attacker is set to an non-existing entry, when victim add to the queue, attacker have full control over this entry, including changing `assets` value.

Consider the scenario
1. Attacker calls `enlistInRollover()` when he has already queued up. His index is `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker] = rolloverQueue.length`.
2. Victim calls `enlistInRollover()` for the first time. His index is also `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[attacker] = rolloverQueue.length` because the `rolloverQueue`'s length is not changed after attacker's call.
3. Attacker calls `enlistInRollover()` to manipulate `rolloverQueue` of victim since his index is duplicated with victim's index.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
    // if so, update the queue
    uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
    rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
    rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
} else {
    // if not, add to queue
    rolloverQueue.push(
        QueueItem({
            assets: _assets,
            receiver: _receiver,
            epochId: _epochId
        })
    );
}
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length; // @audit incorrect in case user has already queued up a rollover
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider only setting value of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` in case user has not already queued up a rollover
