# When updating an existing rollover queue entry, `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` will point to wrong place

## Summary
When enlisting in a rollover, the function *will always* set `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length`.
If we are just editing an existing entry, which was not the last entry in the queue, this will set the pointer wrong.
The queue will become mangled and people might not be able to withdraw their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is in the following [block of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253).
When enlisting in rollover, it differentiates between the case where a rollover entry just needs to be updated (the first if block), and whether a new entry needs to be added (the else block).
However, **in both cases it sets (in the last line)** `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length`.
This means that *even if we are editing an existing entry*, eg. at index 0, the receiver's index will be updated to be the last index.
Obviously this is wrong, and this line should only be executed when a new entry is being added to the queue.
```solidity
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```

## Impact
Rollover queue becomes mangled, and users might not be able to access their funds.
This can happen both maliciously or accidently.
For example consider the following natural sequence of events.
- User Hadbard enlists to rollover 100 shares for next epoch.
- User Malaclypse enlists to rollover 100 shares for next epoch.
- The rollover has not been minted yet.
- Hagbard decides to update his rollover to be only 50 shares.
- The abovepasted piece of code will update his entry to be only 50 shares, **but then update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] := rolloverQueue.length`, so his entry in `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` will point to Malaclypse's entry, which still rolls 100.**
- Hagbard tries to withdraw 50 shares (the ones that he won't rollover). However, since `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` points to Malaclypse's 100 shares, **Hagbard can't withdraw his funds!** Since `notRollingOver` [will think](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L754) that Hagbard is rolling all his 100 shares.
- Confused, Hagbard delists from the rollover. Since `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` points to Malaclypse's entry, actually it is Mal's entry that will be deleted - along with `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Hagbard]`.
- **At this point we already see that Mal's rollover has been deleted, which is already unexpected behavior, which might make Mal lose his rewards.**
- Now Hagbard can withdraw his funds. He decides to withdraw only 50 shares, and he does.
- Now somebody mints the rollover queue. **But Hagbard's entry is still there!** Since it was only Mal's entry that was deleted earlier. **So Hagbard will rollover to the next epoch, although he didn't choose to do so. This will perhaps cause a loss of funds (according to how the epoch plays out).**

There can be various combinations and options for this to go off.

For example also the whole rollover mechanism can be also bricked (if Hagbard had withdrawn all his shares, then `mintRollovers` will revert when trying to burn more shares than Hagbard has.)

**Or, a user can on purpose make another user rollover more shares than he intended.**
This is because early rolloverers can control the last entry in the rollover queue. So they can update their rollover twice:
- The first update will update their own entry, and also set their `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` to point to a legitimate user entry
- The second update [will fetch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L255:#L257) that legitimate user entry, and update it according to the malicious user command (eg. rollover the whole user's amount)
- Then when `mintRollovers` will be called. It burns and mints based on [`queue[index].receiver`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L409), which is the legitimate user, but the amount is `queue[index].assets`, which the malicious user manipulated earlier.

So since a user might lose his funds, even just by natural course of protocol usage, without even being aware of it, I believe the high severity is justified.

## Code Snippet
We can see the problem in the last line, which was described above (way above the perhaps way too long Impact section ðŸ¤” sorry, as the saying goes, "if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter").
```solidity
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the following line to inside the else block, so it will only be exeuted when adding a new entry.
```solidity
        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
