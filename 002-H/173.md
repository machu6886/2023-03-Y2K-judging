# Enlist any user in rollover queue

## Summary
Even if a User is not willing to enlist in rollover queue, Attacker can force enlist them. This is happening due to incorrect index update of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` variable

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let's say there are 3 users in rollover queue

```solidity
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[A] = 1
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[B] = 2
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[C] = 3
```

2. Now lets say User A wants to update his rollover amount, so he calls `enlistInRollover` function
3. Since rollover queue already existed for User A, so below `if` block gets executed

```solidity
// check if user has already queued up a rollover
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {
...
}
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```

4. Let's see how this gets executed

```solidity
if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[A] != 0) { // true since ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[A] = 1
uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(A); // getRolloverIndex(A)=0
rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
} else {
...
}
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[A] = rolloverQueue.length; = 3 (This gets wrong here)

```

5. As we can see everything is fine within the `if` block. The real issue starts after if-else block
6. `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[A]` is updated to `rolloverQueue.length` which is 3 (A,B,C). 
7. This is incorrect and now if User A again calls `enlistInRollover` function then User C data gets updated instead of User A as shown below

```solidity
if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) { // true as ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[A] = 3
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver); // index=3-1=2
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets; // rolloverQueue[2].assets = _assets; , this updates User C as rolloverQueue[2] is User C
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        }
```

## Impact
User funds will be forced enlisted in Rollover queue. This impacts his withdrawing and transferring capability since funds are now rolled over even when he never wished for same

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Index update of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` should happen only within else block as shown below:

```solidity
if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            ...
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
 ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;      
  }
       

        emit RolloverQueued(_receiver, _assets, _epochId);
    }
```
