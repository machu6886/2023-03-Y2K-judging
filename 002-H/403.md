# ownerToRollOverQueueIndex is not set correctly which affects the delistRollover function and notRollingOver modifier

## Summary

In [Carousel](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol) contract, the `enlistInRollover` function handles the user's request for a rollover. The information is saved in a state variable called `rolloverQueue`, and the index to this information for a user is stored in a state variable called `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex`. This index is used when user wants to delist the rollover request or when the `notRollingOver` modifier checks if the funds are rollable. The issue is that this index is not saved correctly. Details below...

## Vulnerability Detail

1. When the user calls the [enlistInRollover](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238) function for the first time, the rollover details are [stored](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L260-L266)(pushed) into the `rolloverQueue`. 
2. And the index which points to user's rollover details in the queue is [saved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268) into the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` state variable.
3. When the user calls the `enlistInRollover` function again, the contract notices that there is an entry in the queue for the user and this just modify's the existing entry. This means the index doesn't change. But still the function [wrongly modifies](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268) the index with the current length of the queue. 
4. When user calls the `delistInRollover` function now, the index which should point out to his rollover details, will point out to some other user's details. This causes chaos in the accounting. 
5. A similar thing happens in functions which uses the `notRollingOver` modifier. As this modifier checks the value of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` for determining whether a user's funds are rollable.

## Impact

Very unexpected working of the protocol where the value of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` is relied upon. I would call it, "complete chaos".

## Code Snippet

The poc was written to show this:

```solidity
    function testElku8() public {

        testDepositIntoQueueMultiple();

        // create new epoch
        uint40 _epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 3 days);
        uint40 _epochEnd = uint40(block.timestamp + 4 days);
        uint256 _epochId = 3;
        uint256 _emissions = 100 ether;

        deal(emissionsToken, address(vault), 500 ether, true);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin, _epochEnd, _epochId);
        vault.setEmissions( _epochId, _emissions);

        uint256 prevEpochUserBalance = 10 ether - relayerFee;

        uint256 prevEpoch = 2;
        // enlist in rollover for next epoch
        console.log("AFTER USER CALLS enlistInRollover");
        helperRolloverFromEpoch(prevEpoch, USER,  5 ether - relayerFee);  //vault.enlistInRollover(_epoch, amount, user);
        console.log("rollover queue length", vault.getRolloverQueueLenght());
        console.log("rollover queue format: (assets, receiver, epochId)");
        console.log("");
        (uint a,address b,uint c) = vault.rolloverQueue(0);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 0: ", a, b, c);
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER));
        console.log("");


        helperRolloverFromEpoch(prevEpoch, USER2, prevEpochUserBalance);
        console.log("AFTER USER2 CALLS enlistInRollover");
        console.log("rollover queue length", vault.getRolloverQueueLenght());
        console.log("rollover queue format: (assets, receiver, epochId)");
        console.log("");
        (a,b,c) = vault.rolloverQueue(0);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 0: ", a, b, c);
        (a,b,c) = vault.rolloverQueue(1);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 1: ", a, b, c);
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER));
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user2: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER2));
        console.log("");


        helperRolloverFromEpoch(prevEpoch, USER,  2 ether - relayerFee);
        console.log("AFTER USER CALLS enlistInRollover SECOND TIME");
        console.log("rollover queue length", vault.getRolloverQueueLenght());
        console.log("rollover queue format: (assets, receiver, epochId)");
        console.log("");
        (a,b,c) = vault.rolloverQueue(0);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 0: ", a, b, c);
        (a,b,c) = vault.rolloverQueue(1);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 1: ", a, b, c);
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER));
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user2: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER2));
        console.log("");

        vm.startPrank(USER);
        vault.delistInRollover(USER);
        vm.stopPrank();   
        console.log("AFTER USER CALLS delistInRollover");
        console.log("rollover queue length", vault.getRolloverQueueLenght());
        console.log("rollover queue format: (assets, receiver, epochId)");
        console.log("");
        (a,b,c) = vault.rolloverQueue(0);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 0: ", a, b, c);
        (a,b,c) = vault.rolloverQueue(1);
        console.log("rollover queue for location 1: ", a, b, c);
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER));
        console.log("ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user2: ",vault.ownerToRollOverQueueIndex(USER2));
        console.log("");

        console.log("");

    }
```

The output from the test is:

```solidity
  AFTER USER CALLS enlistInRollover
  rollover queue length 1
  rollover queue format: (assets, receiver, epochId)

  rollover queue for location 0:  4999999998000000000 0xCCA23C05a9Cf7e78830F3fd55b1e8CfCCbc5E50F 2

  ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user:  2
  ownerToRollOverQueueIndex user2:  2

  AFTER USER CALLS delistInRollover
  rollover queue length 1
  rollover queue format: (assets, receiver, epochId)

  rollover queue for location 0:  1999999998000000000 0xCCA23C05a9Cf7e78830F3fd55b1e8CfCCbc5E50F 2
```

You can see that how the USER2's funds got delisted when USER tried to delist his own rollover.

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode, Foundry

## Recommendation

The index, `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` should be modified only when new data is pushed into the queue and not when the existing data is modified.

so put the 
`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;` 
inside the `else` part of the if statement.
