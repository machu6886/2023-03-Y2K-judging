# The rollover queue system will break

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In [enlistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238-L271) No need to update index of ` ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[ ]` if the user has already queued up a rollover
This [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268) 
```solidity
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
will set the wrong index to `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` if user has already queued up a rollover

## Impact
- Malicious users will be able to `delistInRollover()` for other users
- Users could bypass the modifier `notRollingOver()` ( by `withdraw()`/`safeTransferFrom()`) and this will block the loop in `mintRollovers()`
-  Users could receive more/less 1155 token

## Recommendation
```diff
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
+        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
        }
-        ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
