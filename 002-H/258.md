# Rollover queue index is wrong

## Summary
In `enlistInRollover`, if the user already had an item queued for rollover, it just updates the queue item and does not make any change to the index. However, the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` is set to the last item, which would break the accountings.
```solidity
  // check if user has already queued up a rollover
  if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
      // if so, update the queue
      uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
      rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
      rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
  } else {
      // if not, add to queue
      rolloverQueue.push(
          QueueItem({
              assets: _assets,
              receiver: _receiver,
              epochId: _epochId
          })
      );
  }
  ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length; //@audit index change
```

## Vulnerability Detail
As in the summary, the rollover queue index can be wrongly set. `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` is used in some accounting logics like `getRolloverIndex` and `notRollingOver`, so as the queue index is set to another users', an user can easily mainpulate the rollover queue.
```solidity
  function getRolloverIndex(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
      return ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner] - 1;
  }
```

## Impact
The rollover accounting logic is broken

## Recommendation
Move the statement into the else block.
```solidity
    } else {
        // if not, add to queue
        rolloverQueue.push(
            QueueItem({
                assets: _assets,
                receiver: _receiver,
                epochId: _epochId
            })
        );
+       ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
    }
-   ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
