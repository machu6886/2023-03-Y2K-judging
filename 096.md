# Carousel: admin role can steal user collateral from deposit queue and rollover queue even though admin should not be able to

## Summary
According to the contest page the "admin" role should not be able to steal user funds:
![2023-03-20_11-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118631472/226323586-c01fa0e7-2016-4d1e-8fe8-34e622442543.png)

The issue is caused because the admin can create epochs with arbitrary `epochBegin` and `epochEnd` timestamps.

## Vulnerability Detail
The admin can choose these timestamps as close together as possible.
The closest together is `epochBegin = block.timestamp` and `epochEnd = block.timestamp + 1`.

The admin can then mint all pending deposits in the premium vault and rollover all assets in the premium vault and then take the opposite position in the collateral vault with a very small deposit.

Assuming that 
a) there are no bots in place to monitor for this kind of attack and to make immediate deposits to the collateral vault
b) within the 1 second between `epochBegin` and `epochEnd` there is no depeg

the admin then receives all the funds from the deposit queue and rollover queue that are in the premium vault.

## Impact
The admin can steal user funds even though the sponsor said in the contest page that the admin role should not be able to do this.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to introduce a minimum time between epoch creation and epoch start and between epoch start and epoch end.
E.g. 3 days for both timespans.
This minimum time delay might also be changeable by the timelock.

This allows for sufficient time for users to deposit into the vaults.
If the admin tried to perform the attack other users will deposit into the collateral vault and the admin will only receive his fair share as a regular user.
