# TimeLock cannot execute transaction with value

## Summary
TimeLock lacks the `payable` method and cannot execute transactions with `value`

## Vulnerability Detail
In the TimeLock contract, we can specify the value on the transaction, mainly implemented in queue() and execute(), these two methods are defined as follows:
```solidity
    function queue(
        address _target,
        uint256 _value,
        string calldata _func,
        bytes calldata _data,
        uint256 _timestamp
    ) external onlyOwner {
...

    function execute(
        address _target,
        uint256 _value,
        string calldata _func,
        bytes calldata _data,
        uint256 _timestamp
    ) external onlyOwner returns (bytes memory) {
....

```
We can see that these two methods are not with `payable`

and this contract is also no `receive() payable` or `fallback() payable` or other methods with `payable`

so this contract is unable to accept value (eth)

as a result, if a queue transaction specifies a `value`, it cannot be executed.

Suggestion: Add a `receive() external payable` to the contract or `execute()` to add a `payable` modifier

## Impact

cannot execute transactions with `value`
