# No way to remove dust orders in the rollover queue

## Summary
There isn't a way to remove orders with dust assets in the rollover queue. As such, an adversary can fill it with these dust orders to drive up the cost of mints and reduce the profit earned from relayer fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Orders with dust assets in the rollover queue (orders who won an epoch, and with `assets` < `relayerFee`) can't be removed by anyone except the respective owners of these orders via delisting and withdrawing. Relayers incur the cost for iterating through such orders, but aren't compensated for it. 

It is therefore possible to grief relayers by making rollovers less profitable through the submission of multiple orders via multiple accounts with `_assets = relayerFee`. Furthermore, the attacker bears a one-time cost to deposit & enroll for 1 epoch, but the effect is perpetual as it affects all future epochs.

## Impact
The rollover queue becomes increasingly bloated; rollovers become less profitable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a separate function that incentivises the deletion of dust orders.
