# Triggering null epoch can be prevented by malicious user

## Summary

Triggering null epoch can be prevented by malicious user

## Vulnerability Detail

The triggering of a null requires that either of the two vaults has zero total assets. A malicious or opportunistic user can wait till the deposit period is almost over and if a vault has zero deposits, deposit a very small amount.

This will prevent the triggering of the null epoch where one vault has a high number of assets while the other has very little. 

The malicious/opportunistic user will also stand to gain all the other vaults assets e.g when an epoch ends for the very small deposit they made.

Any vault that approaches the end of the deposit period with the partner vault having 0 assets would become targeted. 

```solidity
 //require this function cannot be called twice in the same epoch for the same vault
        if (premiumVault.epochResolved(_epochId)) revert EpochFinishedAlready();
        if (collateralVault.epochResolved(_epochId))
            revert EpochFinishedAlready();

        //set claim TVL to final TVL if total assets are 0
        if (premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0) {
            premiumVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
            collateralVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);

            premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, 0);
            collateralVault.setClaimTVL(
                _epochId,
                collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId)
            );

            collateralVault.setEpochNull(_epochId);
        } else if (collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0) {
            premiumVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
            collateralVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);

            premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId));
            collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, 0);

            premiumVault.setEpochNull(_epochId);
        } else revert VaultNotZeroTVL();
```


## Impact

Opportunistic/malicious users could target vaults that have 0 assets thus preventing triggering null epochs. They would stand to gain an unfair advantage while preventing users from the partner vault from withdrawing. In the long run, this would harm the protocol as users would stop using it due to the outsized risk of losing their funds for little benefit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

An acceptable ratio of assets between the premium and collateral vaults can be implemented to make this infeasible. It would mean that one vault doesn't have an outsized amount compared to the partner vault.
