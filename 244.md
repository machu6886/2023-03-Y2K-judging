# Reentrancy vulnerability in mintDepositInQueue function

## Summary
Reentrancy Vulnerability found on mintDepositInQueue function
There is a violation of the Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in the function called Carousel. mintDepositInQueue.  This is a re-entrancy vulnerability.  The vulnerability arises because the check for invalid length and queued comes after the update of length and deposit queue, where as it should come before.  The function also contains deposit and safeTransfer functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises because the check for invalid length and queued comes after the update of length and deposit queue, where as it should come before.

## Impact
The impact is that using the function the user can deposit less than they eventually withdraw also using the safeTransfer function in conjunction with the deposit function within reentrancy.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // make sure there is already a new epoch set
        // epoch has not started
        QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
        uint256 length = depositQueue.length;


        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();


        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();
        // relayers can always input a very big number to mint all deposit queues, without the need to read depostQueue length first
        if (_operations > length) _operations = length;


        // queue is executed from the tail to the head
        // get last index of queue
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            emit Deposit(
                msg.sender,
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }


        emit RelayerMinted(_epochId, _operations);


        asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _operations * relayerFee);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
I recommend that the checks are moved before the updates.  Please see below for before and after.

Before: Currently Checks on length and queue come after Updates to length and queue.
```solidity
 QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
        uint256 length = depositQueue.length;

        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();

        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();
```

After: I propose Checks on length and queue come after length and queue update.
```solidity
        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();

        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();

 QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
        uint256 length = depositQueue.length;
```
