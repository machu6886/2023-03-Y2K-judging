# No checks for the treasury and timelock in Factory(vaultFactory and carousalFactory) which can lead to costly redeploy.

## Summary

There are no zero checks on deployment in constructor of both the `carousalFactory` and `vaultFactory` which could lead to costly redeploy.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `vaultFactory` at
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L37](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L37)
and in `carousalFactory`:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/CarouselFactory.sol#L25](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/CarouselFactory.sol#L25)
there are no checks in place for `timelock` to be `Address(0)` and there is no setter function to set the `timelock` after the deployment so if setted wrong on deployment have to redeploy the whole factory.

Same issue was reported in `uniswap V3 audit report` factory by trail of bits and was flagged `medium` so labelled it as medium here too.

## Impact

Can lead to costly redeploy of the carousal factory and vault factory.

## Code Snippet


```solidity
    constructor(address _weth, address _treasury, address _timelocker) {
        if (_weth == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        WETH = _weth;
        timelocker = _timelocker;
        treasury = _treasury; 
    }
```

```solidity

    constructor(
        address _weth,
        address _treasury,
        address _timelock,
        address _emissoinsToken
    ) VaultFactoryV2(_weth, _treasury, _timelock) {
        if (_emissoinsToken == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        emissionsToken = IERC20(_emissoinsToken);
        //@audit-issue -med- same as factory - trail of bits reference not input validation to check treasury and timelock are not zero
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Add zero check to the treasury and timelock in constructor.
2. Add a setter/changeTimelock function for the timelock and change of timelock should be a two step process.
