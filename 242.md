# Re-enlisting in a rollover allows modification of other users' rollover amounts/delisting their rollovers

## Summary
If a user enlists a rollover and then, after another user has enlisted, makes multiple calls to `Carousel.enlistInRollover()`, they can change the rollover amount of the last rollover in the queue, even if it belongs to another user.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is caused because of a logical error in  `Carousel.enlistInRollover()`.

On [line 253](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253), the function checks whether the user (`_receiver` in the code) already has an entry in `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex`. If they do, then the values for this entry are updated. Otherwise, a new entry is appended to `rolloverQueue[]`. However, [on line 268](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268), the value of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` is set to point to the last item in `rolloverQueue[]`. This is fine if the user was not already in the queue: their new entry will indeed be at the end. However, if the user already had a queue entry, line 268 will update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` to indicate that the updating user has ownership of the last item in the queue, even if this is untrue.

As in the POC test below, a single update of this sort will cause only accounting errors and potential reverts. The check `notRollingOver` [on line 196](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L196) of `safeTransferFrom()` might allow a user to transfer out tokens that are committed to roll over, for example, as it may check the last item in the queue, which could have a lower balance than the funds the transferring user has committed to roll over. This would then cause calls to  `mintRollovers()` to revert, as it would not be possible to burn the required tokens [on line 408](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L408).

The serious threat occurs with a second update, however. If the user calls `Carousel.enlistInRollover()` again, as the function itself calls `getRolloverIndex(_receiver)` [on line 255](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L255) to determine which entry in `rolloverQueue` to update. This function in turn uses the value of `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` to give the index for that user. At this point, it will receive the index updated to in the previous update, and allow the user to modify its value, notably the number of assets being rolled over. In this way, one user can modify the rollover amount of another.

Similarly, it is also possible to delist the other user's rollover, as `delistInRollover()` also uses `getRolloverIndex()` to determine which item in `rolloverQueue` to delete.

## Impact

Clearly, allowing users to modify the rollover amounts of other users could have significant impact. For example, if the deposit amounts of other users in the premium vault are significantly increased and the deposit amounts of other users in the collateral vault are significantly reduced then, so long as there is no depeg, a user with a large deposit in the collateral vault would stand to be paid an outsized premium that the other users never intended to pay.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move the update to `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]` on [line 268](https://github.com/Y2K-Finance/Earthquake/blob/736b2e1e51bef6daa6a5ecd1decb7d156316d795/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268) within the `else` block which begins on line 258 so that it only affects users who are adding their rollover item to the end of `rolloverQueue`.
