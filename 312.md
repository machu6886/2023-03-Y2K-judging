# User can burn shares and receive no assets in return

## Summary
User can burn his shares but receive no assets in return.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `VaultV2.sol` contract the withdraw function burns the users share and in turn sends him assets. you can view this logic down below.
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasEnded(_id)
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        if (_receiver == address(0)) revert AddressZero();

        if (
            msg.sender != _owner &&
            isApprovedForAll(_owner, msg.sender) == false
        ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _owner);

        _burn(_owner, _id, _assets);

        uint256 entitledShares;

        if (epochNull[_id] == false) {
            entitledShares = previewWithdraw(_id, _assets);
        } else {
            entitledShares = _assets;
        }
        if (entitledShares > 0) {
            SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledShares);
        }

        emit Withdraw(
            msg.sender,
            _receiver,
            _owner,
            _id,
            _assets,
            entitledShares
        );

        return entitledShares;
    }

```
This function calls into the `previewWithdraw` Function to determine the amount of shares the user is entitled to. that is seen below.
```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
        public
        view
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
    {
        // entitledAmount amount is derived from the claimTVL and the finalTVL
        // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% lower than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 500 assets
        // if user deposited 1000 assets and the claimTVL is 50% higher than finalTVL, the user is entitled to 1500 assets
        entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
    }
```
The problem with this is that since `previewWithdraw` rounds down to 0, the user may burn shares and his asset that is to returned to him may be rounded down to 0 and therefore he has burned his share for no return when he should have expected a return. This is a direct loss of funds for the user. 
when finalTVL[id] > assets * claimTVL[id], the preview amount is rounded to 0.
## Impact
Because the `previewWithdraw` function rounds down instead of up, a user who attempts to withdraw will have his shares burned but he will not receive any assets in return. This is a complete loss of funds for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change 
```solidity
entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
```
to 
```solidity
entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivUp(claimTVL[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
```
also add
```solidity
require(entitledAmount > 0, "0 amount of asset is not valid")
```
