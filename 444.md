# `ETH` WILL BE LOST IF PASSED IN TO `address(0)`

## Summary

In the `execute` function of the `TimeLock.sol` contract, the low level `call` function is used to execute the transaction on the `_target` address. But the `_target` address is never checked for the `address(0)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`execute` function of the `TimeLock.sol` contract does not check the `_target` address against the `address(0)`. But the low level call function is called on the `_target` address by passing in the `ethereum` value by calling `{value: _value}`. This creates the vulnerability of sending ethereum to the address(0).

## Impact

If `eth` is sent to the address(0) in the case `_target` is address(0), the sent `eth` will be lost. Thus creating loss of funds to the user.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        (bool ok, bytes memory res) = _target.call{value: _value}(data);
```

## Tool used

VSCode and Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to check the `_target` address in the `execute` function, against the address(0) as below. This will verify that low level `call` function is not called on `address(0)`.

```solidity
require(_target != address(0), "address(0) is not allowed");
```
