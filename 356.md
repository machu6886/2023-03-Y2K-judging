# The mintRollovers()  function may not work.

## Summary
If there are only two epochs in the array `epochs`, then the `mintRollovers()`  function will not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol sets epoch 0 at initialization to always be able to be deposited in the [queue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L66). After the vault contract has been deployed, the owner of  `VaultFactory` creates a [epoch ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L137-L169)so that user can purchase coverage on a stablecoin depegging event by depositing to the Premium vault, and can similarly sell risk by depositing funds in the Collateral vault. Together with the initialization epoch, there are two epochs in the protocol. Inside the `mintRollovers()` function, it requres that prev epoch is [resolved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L381-L382).If the protocol creates only one epoch, then prev epoch is 0,`epochResolved[epochs[0]]` is false. Then the `mintRollovers()` transaction will fail.
```solidity
function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // epoch has not started
        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();

        uint256 length = rolloverQueue.length;
        uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];

        // revert if queue is empty or operations are more than queue length
        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();

        if (_operations > length || (index + _operations) > length)
            _operations = length - index;

        // prev epoch is resolved
        if (!epochResolved[epochs[epochs.length - 2]])
            revert EpochNotResolved();

        // make sure epoch is next epoch
        if (
            [epochs.length - 1] != _epochId) revert InvalidEpochId();

        QueueItem[] memory queue = rolloverQueue;
```

## Impact
