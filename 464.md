# `epochFee` should have a maximum value

## Summary

The `epochFee` can be set by the owner to any big value (even 100%) which will sends a majority of the vault funds to the treasury instead of the users.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `epochFee` is set by the owner with `createEpoch` and it is used as a withdrawal fee in the controller contract, this fee is in basis point of 10000 (meaning 100% = 10000) but when setting it there is no upper bound as the both the functions `createEpoch` and `_setEpoch` don't check the owner input value (except for non zero check), this means that the owner can for some reason set a high value for this fee for a given epoch which will lead the controller to sending a big part of the funds to the treasury instead of sending them to the users.

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue you should add a maximum value for the `epochFee` just like for the `depositFee`
