# Timelock has atomic owner change process

## Summary
The [`Timelock`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol) has an atomic owner change process, where the owner of the contract is changed with a single call to [`changeOwner`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L171).

## Vulnerability Detail
Changing the owner atomically is an issue under certain conditions -- mainly when the contract in question is the top-level authority. For example, other contracts in the system, such as [`VaultV2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol), also support the same feature. If by accident a wrong address is supplied as the new owner, it can simply be corrected by another owner change through the `Timelock`. 

However, if a wrong address is supplied as owner to the `Timelock` itself, the change is irreversible, and access to the `Timelock` is permanently lost.

## Impact
If access to the `Timelock` is lost, no `Timelock`-authorized methods can be called anymore, such as for example [`changeTreasury`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L228), [`changeController`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L286) and [`changeOracle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L310).  

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a two-step owner change process for the `Timelock`, where a new owner is first proposed as pending owner through `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` and accepted through `function acceptOwnership()`, which must be called from the pending owner.

See [`OZ's Ownable2Step`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) for an implementation.

## Code Snippet
[Timelock.sol@changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L171)

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
    if (_newOwner == address(0)) {
        revert AddressZero();
    }
    policy = _newOwner;
    emit ChangeOwner(_newOwner);
}
```
