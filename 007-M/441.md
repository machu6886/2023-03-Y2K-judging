# DOS in `Timelock` while executing when `_value` passes is greater than zero

## Summary

DOS in `execute` method when `_value` transfered is greater than 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

Mainly, Timelock contract contains methods like `queue`, `execute` and `cancel`.

There is a `call()` method used in `execute` which transfer `_value` worth of eth.

```solidity
File: Timelock.sol

113:    (bool ok, bytes memory res) = _target.call{value: _value}(data);  // @audit payable not there so .call with any value will always fail

```
[Link to Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L113)

Issue here is that the Timelock contract has no way to accept the Eth from when adding the transaction in queue. There is no method with `payable` keyword to accept the eth. Also there is no receive or fallback method.

This is why whenever any transaction will require a value transfer, it will fail the execution as the contract won't have any eth to transfer. This can lead to DOS.

## Impact

DOS for any execution which requires value transfer.

## Recommendation

Add a payable keyword or receive/fallback method to accept the Eth required for the execution.
