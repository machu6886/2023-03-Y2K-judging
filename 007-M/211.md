# Future functionality of vault contract that may require Eth transfer won't be executed via Timelock contract.

## Summary
Since there is no straightforward way to transfer eth to the Timelock contract, any functionality in the vault requiring Eth won't be executed. Moreover, functionality that has `onlyTimelocker` modifier and needs Eth will be rendered useless. 
## Vulnerability Detail
##### Where : In [Timelocker](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L74-L121)

##### Description :     
- There is no payable functions in the timelock contract 
- No receiver or fallback function as well. 
- So it is not possible to transfer eth to contract.
- But `execute()` function transfers Eth value parameter to function calls, although `execute()` function itself is not payable.

**Note:** Also there is no way to upgrade the timelock address in the factory contract.
## Impact
Future functionality requiring Eth transfer via Timelock contract won't be executed

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider implementing the necessary functionality so that the timelock contract can receive ETH before executing a function. This should allow actions that require Ether to be easily triggered from the contract, preventing unexpected behaviors.
