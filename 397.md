# `enlistInRollover()` for same user second time store the wrong index and broke roll over queue if delist right after

## Summary

`Carousel.sol` allow user to move current share from one epoch to latest epoch through `rolloverQueue`.

Each user can only have one rollover queue. If user call `enlistInRollover()` again, it will overwrite the previous queue.

The logic for storing user index is incorrect for [updating previous queue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L268).

## Vulnerability Detail

- `enlistInRollover()` call first time. [New queue will be pushed into array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L260-L266).
- `Carousel.sol` store this user index in `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` as latest `rolloverQueue.length`. Aka, use new pushed queue index as user index.
- `enlistInRollover()` call second time. This go into [first if check and updating user previous queue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253-L257)
- Then `Carousel.sol` also change this user index as latest `rolloverQueue.length`. Despite **no new** `rolloverQueue` was pushed into array.
- The user index for rollover queue is now wrong. If this user call `delistFromRollover()` [right after, it will pop() latest user queue and delete current user index.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L302)
- This allow user to bypass modifier `notRollingOver` also prevent the affected user from delist himself.
- This user with wrong index can call withdraw all funds while still have a queue inside `rolloverQueue` array. Which is not suppose to happen.
- Later Relayer call `mintRollovers()` will be reverted due to this user no longer have enough token share of this epoch. And the execution queue go to halt with no way to skip this.

## Impact

High.

- One user funds will be locked inside rollover queue. Cannot delist -> cannot withdraw their funds too.
- `mintRollovers()` or `rolloverQueue` will be blocked. Prevent any user from moving their share to latest epoch.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Move `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;` inside else case right after array push.
