# Ineffective timelocker due to epoch length

## Summary
The timelocker has a timelock of 3 days, while the epochs length is 7 or 30 days.
Users can not withdraw their funds after an epoch has started.
This renders the timelock ineffective, as users can not withdraw their funds while a malicious timelock transaction is pending,
and the admin can rug the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Y2K docs [state](https://y2k-finance.gitbook.io/y2k-finance/products/earthquake/mechanics#deposit-period) that epochs locking period will be weekly and monthly.
The contest readme states that `Admin Should not be able to steal user funds`.
To mitigate against such risk, a timelocker has been added.
It sets the [waiting period](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L13) as such:
```solidity
    uint32 public constant MIN_DELAY = 3 days;
    uint32 public constant MAX_DELAY = 30 days;
    uint32 public constant GRACE_PERIOD = 14 days;
    function queue(
        ...
        if (
            _timestamp < block.timestamp + MIN_DELAY ||
            _timestamp > block.timestamp + MAX_DELAY
        ) {
            revert TimestampNotInRangeError(block.timestamp, _timestamp);
        }
```
So a transaction has to wait for a minimum of 3 days.
But since epochs last for a week or a month (as per the documentation),
a user that has locked his funds for such a period can not withdraw them in the 3 days of timelock.
He can not effectively do anything to save his funds in case of malicious or compromised admin.

The contest readme states that `Admin Should not be able to steal user funds`.
But for example an admin can rug in the following way:
Once an epoch has started, queue a tx that whitelists his own address for the vault (`whitelistAddressOnMarket`), then queue a tx that whitelists his EOA as controller (`whitelistController`), then queue a tx that changes the controller to his EOA (`changeController`), and after 3 days, he'll execute them all, and use his EOA to call `sendTokens` in the vault and send himself all the user funds.

## Impact
Timelock is not effective.
Admin can rug user funds, which according to the contest readme, should not be possible.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    uint32 public constant MIN_DELAY = 3 days;
    uint32 public constant MAX_DELAY = 30 days;
    uint32 public constant GRACE_PERIOD = 14 days;
    function queue(
        ...
        if (
            _timestamp < block.timestamp + MIN_DELAY ||
            _timestamp > block.timestamp + MAX_DELAY
        ) {
            revert TimestampNotInRangeError(block.timestamp, _timestamp);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe that for the timelock to be effective, it has to have a minimum delay which is longer than the epoch's duration.
