# Max deposit fee hard-capped below protocol design resulting losing potential income

## Summary

Max deposit fee capped below protocol design, it is capped max at 2.5% while the docs (and code's comment) it's 5%

## Vulnerability Detail

According to Y2K [docs](https://y2k-finance.gitbook.io/y2k-finance/products/earthquake/mechanics#protocol-fee), the protocol collects a 5% fee of (premium) deposit. But, in the codebase, when creating initial Carousel vault, the initial depositFee is checked if it's `< 250` basis point. Also when changing depositFee through `changeDepositFee()`, it's limited `if (_depositFee > 250) revert InvalidDepositFee();`

While the issue is a simple typo / misconfiguration, but since fee is related to amount of fund the protocol can get, while it's stated in the docs and code comment, thus I think this is a valid medium.

```solidity
File: Carousel.sol
53:         if (_data.depositFee > 250) revert BPSToHigh();

File: CarouselFactory.sol
186:         if (_depositFee > 250) revert InvalidDepositFee();
```

## Impact

Y2K can't set deposit fee to 5% (based on protocol design), losing potential income.

## Recommendation

Replace the `250` with `500` per protocol design.
