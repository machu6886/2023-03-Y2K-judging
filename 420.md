# Multiplication after Division can cause precision loss

## Summary

Multiplication after Division can cause larger precision loss when calculating fee percent in Carousel.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating fee percent, multiplication is done on the result of division which can lead to larger precision loss.

```solidity
            ((((maxY) / (maxX - minX)) * (int256(block.timestamp) - maxX)) +
                maxY) / (int256(FixedPointMathLib.WAD)) // two point math // scale down
        );
```

maxY is divided by (maxX - minX) before multiplying by (int256(block.timstamp) - maxX). Next, this value is added with maxY. Afterwards, the value is divided by int256(FixedPointMathLib.WAD)



## Impact

Precision Loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Multiply all the numerators first and then divide it with the product of all the denominator to get the least possible precision loss.

Essentially its ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) * (x - x1) + (y2 - y1)), then divided by WAD, to find the value of y. (y2 - y1 = y2 because y1 is 0 as mentioned).

 Can refactor this calculation by multiplying first before dividing twice. ((maxY * (block.timestamp - maxX) / (maxX - minX) ) + maxY)) / int256(FixedPointMathLib.WAD)
