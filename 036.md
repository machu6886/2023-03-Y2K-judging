# Carousel is not EIP-1155 compliant

## Summary
Carousel overrides `safeBatchTransferFrom()` and calls `revert()`. This breaks compatibility with EIP-1155
## Vulnerability Detail
As noted in the Sherlock contest page, contracts should "Should comply wiht 1155 standart." Furthermore, since Carousel inherits from VaultsV2, who's parent is ERC1155, shows intention that Carousel should follow EIP-1155. 

In carousel.sol, `safeBatchTransferFrom()` is overridden to `revert()`. As noted in [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), `safeBatchTransferFrom()` must do the following:
```text
/**
    @notice Transfers `_values` amount(s) of `_ids` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
    MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
    MUST revert on any other error.        
    MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
    After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).                      
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _ids     IDs of each token type (order and length must match _values array)
    @param _values  Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array)
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to`
*/
function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;
```
## Impact
Since V2 intends to make Y2K more compatible, breaking EIP-1155 is dangerous and contradictory to the goal. Other protocols may call `supportsInterface()` to verify that Carousel supports 1155, but will not expect a revert for all scenarios.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing `safeBatchTransferFrom()` to be EIP-1155 compliant.
