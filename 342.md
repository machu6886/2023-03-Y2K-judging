# A malicious user can create and enlist too many deposit queues at row cost, which lead to reverting the transaction because of reaching the block gas limit

## Summary
A malicious user can create and enlist too many deposit queues at row cost, which lead to reverting the transaction of the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()`. Because its transaction will reach the block gas limit.

In addition to that, any users can enlist the deposit queues as much as the users want by calling the Carousel#`_deposit()` by calling the Carousel#`deposit()` or the Carousel#`depositETH()`. And there is no minimum deposit amount within the Carousel#`deposit()` or the Carousel#`depositETH()`. 
These things above allows a malicious user to be able to enlist too many queues at row cost.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Carousel, the `depositQueue` array would be defined like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L27
```solidity
    QueueItem[] public depositQueue;
```

When the Carousel#`deposit()` or the Carousel#`depositETH()` would be called,
the Carousel#`_deposit()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L98
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L117

Within the Carousel#`_deposit()`, a deposit queue would be enlisted by pushing it to the `depositQueue` array like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L495-L497
```solidity
    function _deposit(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
    ) internal {
        ...
        } else {
            depositQueue.push(  /// @audit
                QueueItem({assets: _assets, receiver: _receiver, epochId: _id})
            );
           ...
```

After that, within the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()`, all of deposit queues enlisted in the the `depositQueue` array would be executed by using the loop like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L331
```solidity
    function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // make sure there is already a new epoch set
        // epoch has not started
        QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
        uint256 length = depositQueue.length;

       ...
          // queue is executed from the tail to the head
        // get last index of queue
        uint256 i = length - 1;
        while ((length - _operations) <= i) { /// @audit
            // this loop impelements FILO (first in last out) stack to reduce gas cost and improve code readability
            // changing it to FIFO (first in first out) would require more code changes and would be more expensive
            _mintShares(
                queue[i].receiver,
                _epochId,
                queue[i].assets - relayerFee
            );
            ...

            depositQueue.pop();
            if (i == 0) break;
            unchecked {
                i--;
            }
        }
```
Within the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()` above, the `loop`** would be used for executing all of deposit queues enlisted in the the `depositQueue` array.

In addition to that, any users can enlist the deposit queues as much as the users want by calling the Carousel#`_deposit()` by calling the Carousel#`deposit()` or the Carousel#`depositETH()`. And there is no minimum deposit amount within the Carousel#`deposit()` or the Carousel#`depositETH()`. 
These things above allows a malicious user to be able to enlist too many queues at row cost.

example). 
Assuming that a malicious user deposit just `0.001` (`_assets`) of token into the Vault to create a deposit queue by calling the Carousel#`deposit()`, the malicious user can 1000 deposit queues by depositing just 1 (`_asset`) of tokens into the Vault.

If too many queues would be enlisted by a malicious user, too many processing will be executed via the loop within the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()`.
As a result, the transaction of the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()` will be reverted in the loop. Because its transaction will reach the block gas limit. 

## Impact
A malicious user can create and enlist too many deposit queues at row cost, which lead to reverting the transaction of the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()`. Because its transaction will reach the block gas limit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider setting the limit of the deposit queues to be executed when the Carousel#`mintDepositInQueue()` would be called.
Or,
- Consider setting the minimum deposit amount to avoid that a malicious user can create too many deposit queues at low cost.
