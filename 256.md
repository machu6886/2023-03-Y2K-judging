# Emissions are lost for null epoch

## Summary
Emissions are transferred to the carousel when an epoch is created and returned to users as rewards when they withdraw their funds. However if there are no deposits on the epoch, it would be resolved as an null epoch and no one could claim the emissions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The CarouselFactory transfers emission tokens to the carousels from the treasury.
```solidity
  /* CarouselFactory#createEpochWithEmissions */   
  emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[0], _permiumEmissions);
  ICarousel(vaults[0]).setEmissions(epochId, _permiumEmissions);

  emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[1], _collatEmissions);
  ICarousel(vaults[1]).setEmissions(epochId, _collatEmissions);
```


The only way to gain the emissions is to withdraw or roll over the assets on the epoch.
```solidity
  /* Carousel#withdraw */
  if (entitledEmissions > 0) {
      emissionsToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledEmissions);
  }
```

However, if there are no deposits on the epoch the controller would trigger it as a null epoch. But there is no way to claim the emission tokens back since there are no deposits to withdraw with the emissions, and there are no logic to claim the emissions back from the carousel.
```solidity
  if (premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0) {
      premiumVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
      collateralVault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);

      premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, 0);
      collateralVault.setClaimTVL(
          _epochId,
          collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId)
      );

       collateralVault.setEpochNull(_epochId);
  }
```

## Impact
For a null epoch, emission tokens would be stuck in the contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a logic to return emissions tokens to the treasury in `triggerNullEpoch`.
