# VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury function does not set correct treasury

## Summary
The `VaultFactoryV2.changeTreasury` function allows setting the `treasury` of a certain market (premium + hedge Vaults) to a different `_treasury` address.

However the function sets the wrong `treasury`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultFactoryV2.sol#L228-L246

The function first whitelists the `_treasury` and then changes the Vault treasury to `treasury`.
This is wrong. `_treasury` is the parameter that is passed to the function while `treasury` is a state variable of the `VaultFactoryV2` contract and is not the address that the treasury should be changed to.

The value of `treasury` and `_treasury` do not need to be the same so the Vault treasury can be set to a wrong value.

## Impact
The `treasury` variable of the Vault can be set to a wrong value.
