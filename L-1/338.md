# [M-3] Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData Might Return Stale Results

## Summary

The function does not verify the `updatedAt` timestamp that is returned by the Chainlink Oracle. This creates a vulnerability that allows the protocol to use stale data from the oracle, which may not reflect the current market conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The returned updatedAt timestamp is not checked when calling `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`.

If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started)

## Impact

The function `triggerDepeg` relies on the `latestRoundData` API from Chainlink to determine if a depeg event has occurred. However, if the API returns a stale price that does not match the current market price, the function may fail to detect the depeg and execute the necessary actions. This can result in a loss of funds for the depositors of the premium vault, who will not be able to claim their share of the `collateralTVL`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking the oracle responses `updatedAt` value after calling out to `priceFeed.latestRoundData()` verifying that the result is within an allowed margin of freshness.
