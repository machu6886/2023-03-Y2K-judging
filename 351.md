# DOS attack to mintRollovers()

## Summary
If user transferred his share before mint for rollovers, then the `mintRollovers()` transaction will fail.  The `mintRollovers()` will not work.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Carousel` protocol allows anyone to call the `mintRollovers()` function to mint for rollovers. Inside the function, the protocol will account for how many operations have been done. Then, execute the queue  via a while loop. In this business process, the protocol will burn shares ,transfer tokens to receiver and mint shares. However, if user transfers his NFT to another account after enlistsing in rollover queue, the protocol will be not able to burn the shares and users will be not able to mint for rollovers.

while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
            if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
                uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
                    queue[index].epochId,
                    queue[index].assets
                );
                // mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
                    if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }
                    // @note we know shares were locked up to this point
