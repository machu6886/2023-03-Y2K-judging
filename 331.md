# A malicious user can use the `epoch ID` that is already used multiple times to call the VaultV2#`withdraw()` multiple times

## Summary
When the VaultV2#`withdraw()` would be called, the shares corresponding to that `_id` (epoch ID) would be burned. However, at that time, that `_id` (epoch ID) stored into the mapping storage of the `epochIdExists` would not be deleted. 

This allow a malicious user to be able to use the `epoch ID` that is already used multiple times to call the VaultV2#`withdraw()` multiple times. As a result, a malicious user would be able to receive tokens the that is more amount than the amount that they are supposed to receive.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the VaultV2, the mapping storage of the `epochExists` would be defined like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L42
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public epochExists;
```

Within the VaultV2, 
the `epochIdExists()` modifier would be defined to check whether or not a given `id` (`epoch ID`) would exist like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L448-L451
```solidity
    /** @notice Check if epoch exists
     */
    modifier epochIdExists(uint256 id) {
        if (!epochExists[id]) revert EpochDoesNotExist();
        _;
    }
```

Within the VaultV2#`withdraw()`, 
a given `_id`(epoch ID) would be checked via the `epochIdExists()` modifier. And then, the shares corresponding to that `_id` (epoch ID) would be burned by calling the `_burn()`. 
Finally, the amount (`entitledShares` that `_assets` would be assigned) of tokens deposited would be transferred into the `_receiver` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L157-L158
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L169
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/VaultV2.sol#L179
```solidity
    /**
    @notice Withdraw entitled deposited assets, checking if a depeg event
    @param  _id uint256 identifier of the epoch you want to withdraw from;
    @param _assets   uint256 of how many assets you want to withdraw, this value will be used to calculate how many assets you are entitle to according the vaults claimTVL;
    @param _receiver  Address of the receiver of the assets provided by this function, that represent the ownership of the transfered asset;
    @param _owner    Address of the owner of these said assets;
    @return shares How many shares the owner is entitled to, according to the conditions;
     */
    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        epochIdExists(_id) /// @audit 
        epochHasEnded(_id) /// @audit 
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        if (_receiver == address(0)) revert AddressZero();

        if (
            msg.sender != _owner &&
            isApprovedForAll(_owner, msg.sender) == false
        ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _owner);

        _burn(_owner, _id, _assets); /// @audit 

        uint256 entitledShares;

        if (epochNull[_id] == false) {
            entitledShares = previewWithdraw(_id, _assets);
        } else {
            entitledShares = _assets; 
        }

        if (entitledShares > 0) {
            SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledShares);  /// @audit 
        }
        ...
```

However, even if the shares corresponding to that `_id` (epoch ID) would be burned above, that `_id` (epoch ID) stored into the mapping storage of the `epochIdExists` would not be deleted. 
This allow a malicious user to use the `_id` (epoch ID) that is already used multiple times to call the VaultV2#`withdraw()` multiple times. Because the malicious user can bypass both the `epochIdExists` modifier and the `epochHasEnded()` modifier on the VaultV2#`withdraw()` by using the `_id` (epoch ID).
As a result, a malicious user can receive tokens the that is more amount than the amount that they are supposed to receive.


(Remarks: the Carousel contract has same vulnerability)

## Impact
A malicious user can use the `epoch ID` that is already used multiple times to call the VaultV2#`withdraw()` multiple times. As a result, a malicious user would be able to receive tokens the that is more amount than the amount that they are supposed to receive.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the  VaultV2#`withdraw()`, consider deleting the `_id` (`epoch ID`) after `_burn()` would be called like this:
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(SemiFungibleVault)
        epochIdExists(_id) /// @audit 
        epochHasEnded(_id) /// @audit 
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        if (_receiver == address(0)) revert AddressZero();

        if (
            msg.sender != _owner &&
            isApprovedForAll(_owner, msg.sender) == false
        ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _owner);

        _burn(_owner, _id, _assets);

+       delete epochExists[_id];
        ...
```
