# [Carousel] After some time the mintRollovers wont be cost effective for minters

## Summary

1. **rolloverQueue grows in time:** for many reasons:
   A: at each epoch, all users may lose money and most of them never return. these items remain in rolloverQueue **forever** because no one else can delist them.
   B: An attacker can do this multiple times : from a new account, deposit minRequired amount to epoch 0, and enlist in rollover which cant be minted and remains in rolloverQueue forever

2. mintRollover starts from the beginning of the _queue_ for each new epoch and **skip** items that assets<relayerFee:
```solidity
// mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
    if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
        index++;
        continue;
     }
}
```

**So for each new epoch, minters try to mint all items of _rolloverQueue_ but most of them are not mintable and they get nothing** 

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The _rolloverQueu_ grows in time and mintRollovers won't be cost-effective for minters

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In mintRollovers function, delist items that are not mintable anymore:
Use this code:
```solidity
if (entitledShares < queue[index].assets || queue[index].assets < relayerFee ) {
    _delistInRollover(queue[index].receiver);  //internal function for delisting users
    continue;  //continue with the same index because it is replaced...
}
```
instead of this:
```solidity
// mint only if user won epoch he is rolling over
                if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                    // skip the rollover for the user if the assets cannot cover the relayer fee instead of revert.
                    if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
                        index++;
                        continue;
                    }
```
