# Copy entire array to memory can lead to DOS in functions `mintDepositInQueue` and `mintRollovers`

## Summary
Copy entire array to memory can lead to DOS in functions `mintDepositInQueue` and `mintRollovers`

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `mintDepositInQueue()` is used to mint deposits in `depositQueue`
```solidity=
function mintDepositInQueue(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
    external
    epochIdExists(_epochId)
    epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
    nonReentrant
{
    /// [$audit] copy all of the elements is out-of-gas 
    QueueItem[] memory queue = depositQueue;
    uint256 length = depositQueue.length;

    if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();
    if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();
    if (_operations > length) _operations = length;

    uint256 i = length - 1;
    while ((length - _operations) <= i) {
        ... 
    }

    emit RelayerMinted(_epochId, _operations);
    asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _operations * relayerFee);
}
```
It seems like the developers have paid attention to the scenario when the size of the array `depositQueue` increases massively by declaring parameter `operations` to limit the number of operations which is processed in a call. However, instead of just copying the `operations` last elements of the array `depositQueue` into memory, the function copies the whole array to memory which can make the transaction out-of-gas when the array's size is big. 

## Impact
Function `mintDepositInQueue` and `minRollovers` is unable to use when the size of the array grows enormously. Furthermore, there is no way for the users to withdraw their fund which was deposited into `depositQueue` array.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Interact directly with the storage array `depositQueue` and `rolloverQueue` instead of copying it to memory.
