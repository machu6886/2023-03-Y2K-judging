# The function `Carousel.mintRollovers()` can be DOS due to the updating `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`

## Summary
The function `Carousel.mintRollovers()` can be DOS due to the updating `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `Carousel.mintRollovers()` iterates through `operations` elements in the `rolloverQueue` starting from the element with `index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`. At the end of the call, the function will increase the value of mapping `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` by `execution` which is the number of rollovers has been executed successfully during the call. 
```solidity=
function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
    external
    epochIdExists(_epochId)
    epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
    nonReentrant
{
    ... 
    
    while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
        if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
            uint256 entitledShares = previewWithdraw(
                queue[index].epochId,
                queue[index].assets
            );
            if (entitledShares > queue[index].assets) {
                ... 
                executions++;
            }
        }

    }
    if (executions > 0) rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = index;
}
```
At each iteration `index`, the value of `executions` is increased when: 
* the epoch of `queue[index]` has been resolved && 
* the corresponding `entitledShares` of `queue[index]` is bigger than `relayerFee`

Otherwise the value of `excutions` remains unchanged. Assume that there are some elements that doesn't satisfy 2 conditions above, it can lead to the scenario that one index can be processed 2 times in 2 seperate calls which make the transaction consume more gas than expected. Furthermore, this issue can be worse when there are an enormous elements that violate the conditions which can lead to DOS. 

For example, 
1. Assume that all the elements in the segment [L, R] of the `rolloverQueue` doesn't satisfy the conditions to increase the value of `executions` and the size of `R - L + 1` is big enough to make the user unable to process all of them in 1 transaction due to out-of-gas error. 
2. When a user processes the elements from [L, M] in which M <= R, the value of mapping `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` stay unchanged because there is no elements is executed successfully. So the value of `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` will keep the value `L` forever and the function is unable to use.

## Recommendation
Let the delayer specify which positions they want to execute the rollover
