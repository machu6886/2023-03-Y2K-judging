# Queued deposits can get stuck indefinitely in the deposit queue

## Summary
Queued deposits can get stuck indefinitely in the deposit queue. By taking advantage of this, an attacker can purposefully grief early users by freezing their funds in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The first users to deposit into the deposit queue will be the last to have their deposit minted because the loop in `mintDepositInQueue` implements a First In Last Out stack for deposits.

An attacker can spam the deposit queue with small deposits (with `_assets >= relayerFee`). Doing so, he can grief early depositors by queuing just enough deposits so that it becomes impossible to mint all queued deposit in one call to `mintDepositInQueue` due to out of gas revert. If someone calls `mintDepositInQueue` and mint X deposits, the attacker can back-run the transaction with the same exact number of deposits to make sure early depositors will never get their deposit minted.

Since there is no mechanism allowing users to remove queued deposits, early depositors will risk to have their deposited funds frozen in the contract as long as the attacker decides.

## Impact
An attacker can grief early users by freezing their funds in the contract.
