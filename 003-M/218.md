# rolloverQueue may lead to GAS OUT risk

## Summary
`rolloverQueue` may be too long, leading to GAS OUT
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can add `rolloverQueue` by `enlistInRollover`
and `mintRollovers()` does not remove the `rolloverQueue`.
Only the user can `delistInRollover` to shorten the array, if the user is on the lose side, it is very likely that he will not perform `delistInRollover`.
So `rolloverQueue` is likely to get bigger and bigger
But this array copy is used in these places in the contract or loop array
```solidity
    function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
...
        QueueItem[] memory queue = rolloverQueue;

```
```solidity
    function getRolloverTVL(uint256 _epochId)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 tvl)
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < rolloverQueue.length; i++) {
            if (
                rolloverQueue[i].epochId == _epochId &&
                (previewWithdraw(
                    rolloverQueue[i].epochId,
                    rolloverQueue[i].assets
                ) > rolloverQueue[i].assets)
            ) {
                tvl += rolloverQueue[i].assets;
            }
        }
    }
```

these places can cause GAS OUT, or a lot of wasted GAS
Need to add a method to Remove Invalid queue items from rolloverQueue

## Impact
mintRollovers and getRolloverTVL maybe GAS OUT
