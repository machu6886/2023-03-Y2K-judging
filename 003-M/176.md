# mintRollovers does not update rolloverAccounting[_epochId] causing stuck

## Summary

For each epochId, if the **rolloverQueue is too long**, the relayer will call `mintRollovers` multiple times to process the entire rolloverQueue. One block has a maximum gas limit, so relayer cannot process too many **QueueItem** at one time. The rolloverAccounting mapping records the currently processed rolloverQueue location for each epochId. However, at the end of `mintRollovers` , rolloverAccounting[_epochId] is updated only if executions > 0. `executions` are only incremented by 1 if the QueueItem has won the current epoch and QueueItem.asset is bigger than relayerFee. **Assuming that the maximum number of QueueItems that can be processed each time is 100**, if **none of the first 100 QueueItems in the rolloverQueue** can increase `executions`, then `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` will always be 0. No matter how many times the relayer calls `mintRollovers`, it k**eeps looping through the first 100 QueueItems without moving forward**.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to **the maximum block gas limit**, we assume that `mintRollovers` can process at most 100 QueueItems at a time. Therefore, the relayer cannot change this number arbitrarily. If it is changed to a larger value, the trade will be reverted. Let's assume the following scenario:

**relayerFee is 1e18**. The current epochId is E1, and the next epochId is E2. At present, `rolloverQueue` has 50 normal user `QueueItem`. Bob has deposited 100e18 assets before the start of E1, so `balanceOf(bob, E1) = 100e18`.

1.  Bob creates 100 addresses, each address has `setApprovalForAll` to bob. He calls two functions for each address:
    
    `Carousel.safeTransferFrom(bob, eachAddress, E1, 1e18)`
    
    `Carousel.enlistInRollover(E1, 1e18, eachAddress)`, **1e18 equal to minRequiredDeposit**.
    
2.  `rolloverQueue.length` equals to 150(100+50).
    
3.  As time goes by, E1 ends. The relayer calls mintRollovers(E1, 100) twice, and the entire queue has been processed.
4.  50 normal user has called `delistInRollover` to exit the rolloverQueue. Now, rolloverQueue only has QueueItems for those 100 addresses created by bob. **These 100 QueueItem stay in rolloverQueue forever**. 
5.  E2 is coming. The new user's QueueItem(for E2) is pushed to the rolloverQueue, at the end of the queue.
6.  As time goes by, E2 ends. The relayer calls mintRollovers(E2, 100) many times, rolloverAccounting[E2] is always 0. 

Let's explain why the QueueItem of these 100 addresses does not increase the `executions` variable. **There are two cases here**:

1.  These 100 addresses all lost in E1. It will not enter [[if (titledShares > queue[index].assets)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L401)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L401). So `executions` will be not increased.
2.  These 100 addresses all won in E1. Because each QueueItem.asset is 1e18, and the relayerFee is subtracted, so it must be less than 1e18. Then at E2, it will enter [[if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L403)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L403) to continue. So `executions` will be not increased also.

As mentioned above, starting from E2, `mintRollovers` will always be stuck at the front 100 QueueItem.

## Impact

- `mintRollovers` never work properly.
- The relayer calling `mintRollovers` cannot get the relayerFee from Carousel.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Remove `if (executions > 0)` .
- We should change the single queue to **queue mapping**. In this way, relayer only needs to process the queue corresponding to the epochId.
