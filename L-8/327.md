# malicious user can dos mintRollovers with a blacklisted usdc address

## Summary
malicious user can dos mintRollovers with a blacklisted usdc address
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `mintRollover` function emission tokens are transfered to a receiver. The protocol has  stated that one of these emission tokens can be usdc. The problem here arises when a malicous user decides to input a blacklisted usdc address as the receiver. when the loop reaches this address, the loop will ultimately revert and cause a complete denial of service to the protocol when a user try to process the roll over request. you can observe in the code snippet where emissions token is transfered below.
```solidity
                    // @note emission token is a known token which has no before transfer hooks which makes transfer safer
                    emissionsToken.safeTransfer(
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        previewEmissionsWithdraw(
                            queue[index].epochId,
                            queue[index].assets
                        )
                    );
```
user can set the queue[index].receiver in the code snippet below.
```solidity
 function enlistInRollover(
        uint256 _epochId,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
    ) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
```
which calls
```solidity
   // check if user has already queued up a rollover
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
```
## Impact
Since the `mintRollover` allows the receiver to be set to any address. If a malicious user is to input a blacklisted usdc address. The loop will fail to continue, the function will be frozen permanently and there is no way to unfreeze the function. Funds will be stuck.
