# Rollovers can be DOSed by a malicious attacker by transferring away tokens that are meant to be burned

## Summary
Rollover queue is based on a first in last out basis. In `mintRollovers()`, ERC1155 tokens are burned from users and new ones are minted. Function can be forced to revert if user does not have the required tokens to be burned for.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user can enlist for rollover with the requirement that they have sufficient balance of the ERC1155 tokens. However, after enlisting, user can transfer away the underlying ERC1155 token using `safeTransferFrom()`. This would prevent any deposits made before the malicious user in the rollover queue from executing since it will revert at this rollover.

## Impact
A malicious attacker can completely prevent rollovers from happening by this attack. They can also safely delist should they not want to continue the attack anymore, hence making this a very low cost attack.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider skipping a particular rollover if it does not have the required ERC1155 tokens, instead of reverting the entire queue.
