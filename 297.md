# Malicious users could block the Rollovers Queue system

## Summary
`mintRollovers()` attempts to be non-atomic ( doesn't revert the transaction if one fails )

## Vulnerability Detail
From [ contest details](https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/57)
 On-chain context ERC20: [WETH, USDC, Y2K]
So In case `emissionsToken` is **USDC** Malicious user(recipient) **can block the address from receiving USDC** by adding it to the USDC blacklist (e.g. by doing something malicious with that address, etc.)

The USDC “Blacklist Policy” states that when an address is “blacklisted,” it can “no longer receive USDC.

this will lead [mintRollovers()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L420-L421) to keep reverting in this market (the Rollovers Queue system is down now)

## Impact
Malicious users could block the Rollovers Queue system

## Recommendation
Instead of sending emissions tokens directly to the recipient in `mintRollovers()`, consider storing the number of tokens in a variable and create an emissions claimer
