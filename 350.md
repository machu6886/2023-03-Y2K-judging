# Due to lack of the validation to check whether or not the balance of `emissionsToken` would be enough to be transferred to the `_receiver`, the `_receiver` may be not able to withdraw their underlying tokens

## Summary
Due to lack of the validation to check whether or not the balance of `emissionsToken` would be enough to be transferred to the `_receiver`, the transaction of the Carousel#`withdraw()` will be reverted even if there are enough balance of underlying tokens to be withdrawn in the Vault.


## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Carousel#`withdraw()`,
the amount (`entitledEmissions`) of `emissionsToken` would be transferred to the `_receiver` after the amount (`entitledShares`) of the underlying tokens would be transferred like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L166-L168
```solidity
    /**
    @notice Withdraw entitled deposited assets, checking if a depeg event
    @param  _id uint256 identifier of the epoch you want to withdraw from;
    @param _assets   uint256 of how many assets you want to withdraw, this value will be used to calculate how many assets you are entitle to according the vaults claimTVL;
    @param _receiver  Address of the receiver of the assets provided by this function, that represent the ownership of the transfered asset;
    @param _owner    Address of the owner of these said assets;
    @return shares How many shares the owner is entitled to, according to the conditions;
     */
    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(VaultV2)
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasEnded(_id)
        notRollingOver(_owner, _id, _assets)
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        ...
        if (entitledShares > 0) {
            SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledShares);
        }
        if (entitledEmissions > 0) {
            emissionsToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledEmissions);  /// @audit
        }
        ... 
```

However, within the Carousel#`withdraw()` above, there is only check whether or not the amount (`entitledEmissions`) of `emissionsToken` would be more than `0`.
There is no validation to check whether or not the balance of `emissionsToken` would be enough to be transferred to the `_receiver`.

If there is not enough balance of `emissionsToken` to be transferred to the `_receiver` in the Vault, the transaction of the Carousel#`withdraw()` will be reverted even if there are enough balance of underlying tokens to be withdrawn in the Vault.

## Impact
If there is not enough balance of `emissionsToken` to be transferred to the `_receiver` in the Vault , the `_receiver` cannot withdraw their underlying tokens even if there are enough balance of underlying tokens to be withdrawn in the Vault.


## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the Carousel, the Carousel#`balanceOfEmissions()` would be already defined like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L699-L705
```solidity
    /** @notice returns the total emissions balance
     * @return totalEmissions total emissions balance
     */
    function balanceOfEmissions(address _owner, uint256 _id)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return _emissionsBalances[_id][_owner];
    }
```

So, within the Carousel#`withdraw()`, consider adding the Carousel#`balanceOfEmissions()` above to the line where is  before the `emissionsToken.safeTransfer()` would be called.
Also, if there is not enough balance of `emissionToken` to be transferred to the `_receiver` in the Vault, the processing of transferring the `emissionToken` to the `_receiver` should be passed. To judge whether or not the processing of it would be passed. the conditional branch should be also added like this:
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver,
        address _owner
    )
        external
        virtual
        override(VaultV2)
        epochIdExists(_id)
        epochHasEnded(_id)
        notRollingOver(_owner, _id, _assets)
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        ...
        if (entitledEmissions > 0) {
+           uint256 emissionsBalance = balanceOfEmissions(_receiver, _id);
+           If (emissionsBalance > entitledEmissions) {
+               emissionsToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledEmissions);
+           }
-           emissionsToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, entitledEmissions);  
        }
        ... 
```
