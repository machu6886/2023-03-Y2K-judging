# triggerNullEpoch could be frontrun by triggerEndEpoch

## Summary
In ControllerPeggedAssetV2, [triggerNullEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L208) could be frontrun by [triggerEndEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L144) 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `triggerEndEpoch` it doesn't validate that the `totalAssets` of `premiumVault` and `collateralVault` must both be positive. So let's suppose following scenario,

1. A market is created and user deposits into `premiumVault` but there is no deposits in `collateralVault`
2. The current timestamp has passed `epochEnd`, and then someone triggered `triggerNullEpoch`
3. A bot frontruns it and call `triggerEndEpoch`, the tokens in `premiumVault` will be transferred into `collateralVault` with fees transferred into treasury. 

Actually `triggerEndEpoch` can always be triggered when `epochEnd` is reached

## Impact
I think this is a high vulnerability as when this happens, since there is no deposits in `collateralVault` so all tokens transferred to it are locked and no one can withdraw it.

## Code Snippet
I created following test in ControllerPeggedAssetV2Test. It proves that when there is no deposits in `collateralVault`, `triggerEndEpoch` can still be triggered and tokens will be transferred into `collateralVault`. 

```solidity
contract ControllerPeggedAssetV2Test is Helper {
    function testTriggerEndEpoch_noDepositsInCollateralVault() public {
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).mint(USER, 10 ether);
        
        vm.startPrank(USER);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(address(vault), 10 ether);
        vm.warp(begin - 1);
        vault.deposit(epochId, 10 ether, USER);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // Before triggerEndEpoch premiumVault has assets but collateralVault has NO assets
        assertEq(MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(address(vault)), 10 ether);
        assertEq(MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(address(counterpartyVault)), 0);
        assertEq(counterpartyVault.totalAssets(epochId), 0);
        
        vm.warp(end + 1);
        controller.triggerEndEpoch(marketId, epochId);
        
         // After triggerEndEpoch tokens are all transferred to collateralVault and treasury
        assertEq(MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(address(vault)), 0);
        assertEq(MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(address(counterpartyVault)) > 0, true);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `triggerEndEpoch` add following validation

```solidity
        if (
            premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0 ||
            collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0
        ) {
            revert VaultZeroTVL();
        }
```
