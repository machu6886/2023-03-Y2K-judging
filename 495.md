# Rollover doesn't check next epoch `minRequiredDeposit` (relayerFee)

## Summary

rollover doesn't check next epoch `minRequiredDeposit` in scenario where the next epoch's `relayerFee` is increasing, resulting a failed mint of the rollover

## Vulnerability Detail

When user want to enlist rollover, they will call `enlistInRollover()` which have modifier `minRequiredDeposit` of asset they are trying to rollover. but then `mintRollovers` doesn't check again this `relayerFee` (because it might be increased).

if for example a user deposit a minimum amount of deposit, so to speak, they just deposit right amount just to pass `minRequiredDeposit`, then when the next epoch's relayerFee is greater than previous relayerFee, the `mintRollovers()` will failed.

```solidity
File: Carousel.sol
436:                     uint256 assetsToMint = queue[index].assets - relayerFee;
```

since the asset is previously equal to relayerFee (on previous epoch), and if next epoch the relayerFee is increasing, this will failed / reverted without any handling.

## Impact

User will failed to rollover their position because next epoch's `relayerFee` might be larger than previous epoch's `relayerFee`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When calling `enlistInRollover` need to have a check on if the asset amount will pass the  `minRequiredDeposit` (or not less than next epoch's relayerFee). because if not it will successfully enlisted in rollover, but later when trying to mint, it will failed.
