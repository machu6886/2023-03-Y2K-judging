# User can avoid paying depositFee by rolling over from previous epoch

## Summary
Deposit fees are imposed on users, and users pay more if they deposit at a time closer to when epoch is going to start. This is due to how there is an informational advantage for later depositors since they can make decisions based on more factors compared to the earlier depositors.

By making use of rollovers, savy users can avoid this fee and have a very real advantage over other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposit fees are only paid in `_deposit()`. If a user chooses to rollover from a previous epoch, they can skip the fees. In fact, users can choose to enter a vault position at the last second by `enlistRollover()` -> `mintRollovers()`, hence avoiding the hefty depositFee they are supposed to pay since they are entering the position right before epoch starts.

Savy users can abuse the rollover mechanism, putting users who enter a position via `_deposit()` at a serious disadvantage. 

## Impact
Users who rollover can avoid the depositFee, and can do it right before epoch starts, gaining huge informational advantage over other users.
