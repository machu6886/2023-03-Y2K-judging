# Increasing the `relayerFee` create a risk for relayers

## Summary
If the timelock admin increases the `relayerFee`, relayers will risk to call `mintRollovers` without ever being rewarded.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `mintRollovers` the below condition can only be met if the timelock admin changes the `relayerFee`.

[Carousel.sol#L403-L406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L403-L406)
```solidity
          if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
              index++;
              continue;
          }
```
This is because when a user call `enlistInRollover` he cannot set an `assets` member to his queue item struct lower than `relayerFee`. This condition is checked in:

[Carousel.sol#L739-L742](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L739-L742)
```solidity
    modifier minRequiredDeposit(uint256 _assets) {
        if (_assets < relayerFee) revert MinDeposit();
        _;
    }
```
If the timelock admin increases the `relayerFee`, any roll over enlisted before this change will potentially not be mintable. Therefore a relayer calling `mintRollovers` will have no guarantee to get paid at all.

Example:
- Attacker monitors the mempool and front-run the timelock admin call to increase `relayerFee` by a large number of call to `enlistInRollover` with `_assets == relayerFee`.
- Timelock admin increase `relayerFee`.
- Relayer call `mintRollovers` with `_operations == 25` but doesn't get any relayer fee since all the roll over of the attacker in the roll over queue pass the check `queue[index].assets < relayerFee` and will not get executed.

## Impact
When the timelock admin increase `relayerFee` it create a risk for relayers to call `mintRollovers` without ever being rewarded.

I would like to emphasize the reasons why I think this vulnerability is a medium severity issue:
- The timelock admin increasing or decreasing the `relayerFee` does not require any error from him. It will happen in normal condition overtime.
- Relayers are at risk to call `mintRollovers` without being rewarded because of the check `queue[index].assets < relayerFee` in `mintRollovers`. The check might have been introduced because without it relayers could get paid more than what users sent if `relayerFee` is increased (relayer fees would be paid based on current `relayerFee` value which is higher than before). But is not sufficient as I showed.
- The fix I provide allows the timelock admin to change the `relayerFee` value without economic consequences for relayers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the check in `mintRollovers`:
[Carousel.sol#L403-L406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L403-L406)
```solidity
          if (queue[index].assets < relayerFee) {
              index++;
              continue;
          }
```

And, constraining the value of `_assets` being rolled over to be at least more than a maximum value of `relayerFee` (a maximum value will also need to be added):
[Carousel.sol#L739-L742](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L739-L742)
```solidity
    modifier minRequiredDeposit(uint256 _assets) {
        if (_assets < maxRelayerFee) revert MinDeposit();
        _;
    }
```
