# Update new `RelayerFee` will allow anyone to DOS `mintDepositInQueue` function in `Carousel.sol`

## Summary

`RealyerFee` is fixed amount setup by Timelock contract.

Project have modifier `minRequiredDeposit` check everywhere to prevent user deposit less than minimum required payment amount for relayer fee.

The relayer fee can be increased at later time by admin with timelock delay of 3 days.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Anyone can deposit the current minimum amount of `RelayerFee` right before `Timelock` admin execution `updateRelayerFee` function.

- The deposit [will go into `depositQueue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L495-L497).

- Relayer user/contract try to call `mintDepositInQueue()` [will be reverted due to old deposit asset amount less than new relayerFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L337).

## Impact

High because `depositQueue` will stopped working. All users deposit before cannot move share into new epoch during this period.

Indirect opportunity cost for users have to wait for admin update `RelayerFee` again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There simply many ways to DOS `depositQueue` from working.

Dirty fix using try catch and throw failed queue item into new array for user to withdraw might work.

Otherwise, use math.max(a,b) check to prevent underflow revert. Underwrite cost.
