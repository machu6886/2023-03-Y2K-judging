# Time delay for setting relayerFee means that transactions might not be executed or users pay too much fees

## Summary
Users pay a `relayerFee` in order to get their queued deposits minted ([`Carousel.mintDepositInQueue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L310-L355) function) and to get rollovers minted ([`Carousel.mintRollovers`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L361-L459) function).

The `relayerFee` can only be changed by the `TimeLock` contract by calling the [`CarouselFactory.changeRelayerFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/CarouselFactory.sol#L163-L177) function.

The purpose of the `relayerFee` is to be big enough to allow the relayers to earn a bit of profit from executing transactions.
As such the `relayerFee` must be adapted to changing Gas prices.

The issue is that the `TimeLock` contract has a `MIN_DELAY` of 3 days.

This means that a transaction to change the `relayerFee` can only be executed 3 days after it has been queued in the `TimeLock` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say the Gas price increases and relayers can no longer profitably execute transactions.

Now it will take at least 3 days to change the `relayerFee`. Until then someone needs to execute transactions at a loss or no deposits / rollovers are minted.

On the contrary the Gas price might drop such that the profit for relayers becomes too large.
This is an unnecessary loss to users and it takes at least 3 days before changes take effect.

## Impact
Deposit mint / rollover mint transactions might not be executed because it is not profitable to do so or users pay relayer fees that are too high which means they lose a small amount of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest that instead of the `TimeLock` setting the `relayerFee`, the `TimeLock` should only be able to specify a range of allowed values for the `relayerFee` such that the `owner` role can set the `relayerFee` to any allowed value. The `owner` can thereby quickly react to changes in the Gas price and he can even automate this process.
