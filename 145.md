# Deposit fee deduction is always in 18 decimals

## Summary
Deposit fee is always deducted in 1e18 decimals assuming the vaults underlying asset is in 18 decimals.
## Vulnerability Detail
Considering that maxY is in 10^18 decimal precision (same as WAD), the decimal precision of the entire equation will also be in 10^18 decimal precision.

This is because when you divide maxY by (maxX - minX), the result will still have a 10^18 decimal precision. Then, when you multiply this result by (int256(block.timestamp) - maxX), the result will still have a 10^18 decimal precision. Finally, when you divide the sum by WAD, you'll essentially be scaling it down to maintain the same 10^18 decimal precision.

So, the decimal precision of the entire equation will be 10^18. Regardless of the vaults assets decimals. If some point in the future
USDC-USDT would be used as a vaults assets depositFee will return an 1e18 decimal value which deposits will not go through because the fee will be higher than the actual deposited amount.
