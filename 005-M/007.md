# No pause and unpause functionality when changing an oracle for market

## Summary
There is no pause and unpause functionality when TimeLock needs to change an oracle for the market.

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose an oracle has a problem and the provider needs to change the address of the oracle. So we need to make a change on the oracle address for the market by TimeLock contract. but based on the TimeLock contract it take time to make change ! And in this period of time, the protocol continues to work based on the previous oracle. for example function triggerDepeg at ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L51 for Trigger depeg event.

>     uint32 public constant MIN_DELAY = 3 days;
>     uint32 public constant MAX_DELAY = 30 days;
>     uint32 public constant GRACE_PERIOD = 14 days;

## Impact
If there is a need to make changes in the important addresses of the protocol, you must stop the operation of the protocol or important and related functions and after making the changes, the protocol will continue to work. Otherwise, due to working with wrong data, users' funds can be at risk.
