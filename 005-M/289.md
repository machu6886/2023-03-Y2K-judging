# lack of disaster recovery mechanisms

## Summary
Protocol lacks common disaster recovery mechanisms:
 - Pause/Unpause
 - Token rescue
 - Clear deposit and rollover queue.

This is especially true for Carousel vaults where a lot more is going on, with queues and deposits waiting to be put in an epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail
In case of an emergency or previously undiscovered bug the protocol might need to pause and do recovery of state. In extreme cases a migration to a new vault might even be needed.

Since carousel vaults contain a lot more state and logic than normal V2 vaults some sort of disaster recovery is justified.

The protocol already has all the privileges needed to do this behind the scenes (change controller and so on...) so there is no real shift in trust.

## Impact
In unforeseen scenarios tokens might get stuck. State of queues might get wrong and end user funds locked.

## Code Snippet
Hard to have a specific snippet here so linking deposit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend the protocol implements pause/unpause functionality for critical functions like `deposit` and minting of queued items.

Also recommend the protocol to add a way to rescue locked tokens in the vault and a way to clear queues in case they end up in a unrecoverable state.
