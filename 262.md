# Request to rollover the next epoch will be accepted, but never minted

## Summary
If for the next epoch, user is depositing assets and immediately requests to roll them over,
his `enlistInRollover` transaction will succeed,
but `mintRollovers` will skip over his entry, and not mint his rollover.
User will assume he will participate in the epoch after the next one,
but actually he won't. His assets will just sit idly on the contract, not collecting his reward.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at a POC to demonstrate the issue.
- Let's say we are in the deposit period for the next epoch, epoch number 23.
- User Hagbard deposits 55555 assets. He receives 55555 shares.
- He already wishes to set up to roll these assets over for the next epoch as well.
- He calls `enlistInRollover`, [where](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238) all the checks succeed: the next epoch exists, and he has sufficient balance. His entry is added to the queue.
- Hagbard merrily goes about his way, perhaps even merrily whistling a joyful tune. ðŸŽ¶
- Relayers call `mintRollovers`. When it reaches Hagbard's entry, it [skips over it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L395), as his epoch (the next one) is not yet resolved.
- However, the [index](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L450) is anyway updated at the end. (we can safely assume that there was another user in the list, that was minted, so `executions` is bigger than 0.)
- Next time `mintRollovers` is called, it [will start](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L372) only from the previously reached index
- And so, Hagbard's request will not be minted.
- After some time, Hagbard come to collects his rewards, for example collateral in case of depeg, but realises that for some reason, his rollover request has not been minted!
- He complains at the Discord and ruins everybody's vibe. ðŸ˜“

## Impact
When the user asks to enlist for a rollover, his transaction will succeed,
but it will actually not be respected and minted, and his assets will just sit idly on the contract.
While the user's prinicipal is not lost - the user can ask to delist and withdraw it - still, he will lose out on the possible premium/collateral rewards he was supposed to get, had his request been minted. He had no indication that it will not be minted. Therefore, I believe a medium severity is appropriate.

## Code Snippet
We can see that `enlistInRollover` will let a user rollover the current not yet started epoch:
```solidity
    function enlistInRollover(
        uint256 _epochId,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
    ) public epochIdExists(_epochId) minRequiredDeposit(_assets) {
        // check if sender is approved by owner
        if (
            msg.sender != _receiver &&
            isApprovedForAll(_receiver, msg.sender) == false
        ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _receiver);
        // check if user has enough balance
        if (balanceOf(_receiver, _epochId) < _assets)
            revert InsufficientBalance();
```

And that `mintRollovers` will skip this epoch, and will later start from a further index.
```solidity
    function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        // epoch has not started
        // dont allow minting if epochId is 0
        if (_epochId == 0) revert InvalidEpochId();

        uint256 length = rolloverQueue.length;
        uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];

        // revert if queue is empty or operations are more than queue length
        if (length == 0) revert OverflowQueue();

        if (_operations > length || (index + _operations) > length)
            _operations = length - index;

        // prev epoch is resolved
        if (!epochResolved[epochs[epochs.length - 2]])
            revert EpochNotResolved();

        // make sure epoch is next epoch
        if (epochs[epochs.length - 1] != _epochId) revert InvalidEpochId();

        QueueItem[] memory queue = rolloverQueue;

        // account for how many operations have been done
        uint256 prevIndex = index;
        uint256 executions = 0;

        while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            // only roll over if last epoch is resolved
            if (epochResolved[queue[index].epochId]) {
                        // @only here will actual minting take place
                        ...
            }
        if (executions > 0) rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = index;

```
Therefore, his request to rollover the assets from the current epoch (`epochs[epochs.length - 1]`) will be lost.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I am not sure if this is the best way to tackle this, but perhaps you should revert in `enlistInRollover` if the user is asking to rollover the current not yet started epoch.
