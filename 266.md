# `mintRollovers()` will skip The user's queue arbitrarily

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In case Bob has already queued up a rollover
Let's say: 
All the queues are already minted by relayers for epoch Y. The epoch Y exists and has not started yet 

`ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[address(Bob)] == rolloverQueue.length - 1`
and `rolloverAccounting[epoch Y] == rolloverQueue.length - 1`

Bob will invoke [delistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L276-L304) this logic will execute

```solidity
        if (index == length - 1) {
            // if only one item in queue
            rolloverQueue.pop();
            delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
        }
```
Now Alice will call [enlistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238-L271) this logic will execute
```solidity
else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
``` 
After that Eve will also invoke [enlistInRollover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L238-L271) this logic will execute
```solidity
else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
        }
```     
relayer now will call `mintRollovers()`. only the queue of Eve will execute. 
Alice needs to wait until the next epoch Y+1   

## Impact
`mintRollovers()` will skip Alice's queue arbitrarily 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol should handle this scenario correctly (The queue of both Alice and Eve should be executed)
