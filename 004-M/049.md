# Carousel vaults without any deposits will lose emissions

## Summary
Carousels that have emissions that end as null events, will cause one/both side(s) to lose emissions tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a Carousel is created, it can have emissions added to the epoch. Currently, when the epoch ends (with/out a depeg event), the depositors can claim their share of emissions. However, when there are no depositors for that epoch, emissions cannot be claimed. This is resolved as a null epoch. No one will have the epoch's tokens to burn and claim the emissions (done within `withdraw()`).

## Impact
This is high impact because emission tokens will be lost in **null** epoch. Currently, there is no way to recover unclaimed tokens.

## Code Snippet
Emission tokens are added:

Emission tokens are calculated upon `withdraw()`. If there is a null epoch, no one will have that epoch's tokens, burns will `revert`, and thus emissions cannot be claimed:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider allowing emissions to be reclaimed by treasury, or possibly, rolled over to another epoch.
