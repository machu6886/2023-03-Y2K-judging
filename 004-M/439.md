# Emissions would be lost in null epochs

## Summary
When an epoch with emissions is created, the emission tokens are pulled from the treasury.
But if an epoch is a null epoch, the emissions are not sent back to the treasury.
They just sit in the contract,
unable to be claimed by anybody.
Therefore the tokens are totally lost,
like tears in rain.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an epoch is created, the emissions [are pulled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/CarouselFactory.sol#L148):
```solidity
        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[0], _permiumEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[0]).setEmissions(epochId, _permiumEmissions);

        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[1], _collatEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[1]).setEmissions(epochId, _collatEmissions);
```

If an epoch is null, no one can claim these emissions.
Yet they are not sent back to the treasury.
Therefore they are simply lost in the contract.
We [can see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L208) in `triggerNullEpoch` that nowhere are the emissions returned to the treasury.

## Impact
Protocol funds (emission tokens) are lost.

## Code Snippet
Please see above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `triggerNullEpoch`, for every vault which had no deposits, send the emissions back to the treasury.
