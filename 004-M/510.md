# Emissions sent to vault with null epoch will be lost forever

## Summary

When the emissions of the vault are set for a specific epoch they are immediately sent to the contract. When an epoch is null it never reclaims the emissions causing them to be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function createEpochWithEmissions(
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint40 _epochBegin,
        uint40 _epochEnd,
        uint16 _withdrawalFee,
        uint256 _permiumEmissions,
        uint256 _collatEmissions
    ) public returns (uint256 epochId, address[2] memory vaults) {
        // no need for onlyOwner modifier as createEpoch already has modifier
        (epochId, vaults) = createEpoch(
            _marketId,
            _epochBegin,
            _epochEnd,
            _withdrawalFee
        );


        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[0], _permiumEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[0]).setEmissions(epochId, _permiumEmissions);


        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[1], _collatEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[1]).setEmissions(epochId, _collatEmissions);
    }

Here we see the tokens are taken when emissions are created. If there is a null epoch there is no on not claim the tokens so they are lost forever because they aren't transferred back during setting of the null epoch

## Impact

Emissions are lost when there is a null epoch

Reclaim emissions on null epoch
