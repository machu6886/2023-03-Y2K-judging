# emissions for null epochs are lost

## Summary
Emissions are sent to the vaults upon epoch creation. If no one stakes in the vault during the epoch the emissions in that vault will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating an epoch for Carousel the owner has the choice to add emissions for that epoch, that are distributed to stakers:

These emissions are then locked to that epoch:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L591-L597

If no one stakes in the vault during this epoch (null epoch) these emission tokens will be lost in the contract forever as there are no shares to split them with:

## Impact
All emission tokens for an epoch will be effectively burnt if there are no stakers during that epoch (null epoch). 

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `finalTVL` is `0` for an epoch (no stakers). Return all emissions for that epoch to `treasury`:
Add to `Carousel.sol`:
```solidity
    function resolveEpoch(uint256 _id)
        external
        override(VaultV2)
    {
        super.resolveEpoch(_id);

        // null epoch, no stakers, hand back emissions
        if(finalTVL[_id] == 0) {
            emissionsToken.safeTransfer(treasury,emissions[_id]);
        }
    }
```
