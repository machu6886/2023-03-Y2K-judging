# Emissions on null epoch can't be recovered

## Summary
When carousel market epoch ends up with zero deposits in one of the pools, the emissions sent to this pool will be lost

## Vulnerability Detail
Emissions are sent to both pools from the treasury when creating an epoch.
```solidity
        (epochId, vaults) = createEpoch(
            _marketId,
            _epochBegin,
            _epochEnd,
            _withdrawalFee
        );

        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[0], _permiumEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[0]).setEmissions(epochId, _permiumEmissions);

        emissionsToken.safeTransferFrom(treasury, vaults[1], _collatEmissions);
        ICarousel(vaults[1]).setEmissions(epochId, _collatEmissions);
```
Emissions then can be retrieved from pools proportionally to users' deposit amounts. If one or both pools have no deposits at the end of the epoch, these emissions will be lost. There will be no users eligible to claim and there is no mechanism to recover sent emissions.

## Impact
Emissions are taken from the treasury and get lost in the vault. Instead, these emissions could be used somewhere else to incentivize protocol participation. Even though null epochs are not expected to be common, it is a value loss

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override `setEpochNull` for carousel and transfer emissions back to treasury if a vault has not deposits.
```solidity
    function setEpochNull(uint256 _id) public onlyController epochIdExists(_id) epochHasEnded(_id) {
        epochNull[_id] = true;
        if (finalTVL(_id) == 0) {
            emissionsToken.safeTransfer(treasury, emissions[_id]);
        }
    }
```
