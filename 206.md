# enlistInRollover/delistInRollover lack nonReentrant

## Summary
`enlistInRollover()/delistInRollover()` Lack of reentrant protection provides the possibility to maliciously reentrancy modify other people's `rolloverQueue`, resulting in the queue may be blocked

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintRollovers()`  mints for rollovers
The code is as follows:
```solidity
    function mintRollovers(uint256 _epochId, uint256 _operations)
        external
        epochIdExists(_epochId)
        epochHasNotStarted(_epochId)
        nonReentrant
    {
....

        while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
...
                    _mintShares(queue[index].receiver, _epochId, assetsToMint); //@audit<------if receiver is contract ,will call receiver.onERC1155BatchReceived
                    emit Deposit(
                        msg.sender,
                        queue[index].receiver,
                        _epochId,
                        assetsToMint
                    );
                    rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
                    rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
                    // only pay relayer for successful mints
                    executions++;
                }
            }
            index++;
        }
```

From the above code, we can see that `_mintShares (receiver)` will be called, and then modify `rolloverQueue [index].assets`
If the receiver is a contract, `receiver.onERC1155BatchReceived()` will be called, thus providing the possibility of malicious reentrancy

And `enlistInRollover()` `delistInRollover()` does not have `nonReentrant` modifier

Malicious users can reentrancy and adjust the `rolloverQueue`, resulting in the modified `rolloverQueue [index].assets` may not belong to the original user
Example:
Suppose current rolloverQueue:
rolloverQueue[.] = ...
rolloverQueue[9] = jack asset =100
rolloverQueue[10] = Alice   asset =100    <------malicious contract and rolloverAccounting[_epochId] =10
rolloverQueue[11] =  bob  asset =10
 
1. Alice call `mintRollovers(_operations=1)`
2. _mintShares() -> call `Alice.onERC1155BatchReceived()`
3. in onERC1155BatchReceived() Alice call delistInRollover(),   `rolloverQueue` become:
rolloverQueue[.] = ...
rolloverQueue[9] = jack asset =100
rolloverQueue[10] = bob   asset =100    <------alice remove , set to bob
4. after onERC1155BatchReceived() , back to `mintRollovers()` ,  set  rolloverQueue[10].assets = 100
( index=10, No longer belongs to Alice)

This way modifies bob's rolloverQueue [10].assets, Subsequent other calls `mintRollovers` will fail.
because if bob's shares are not enough assets, when ` burn()` will fail,
