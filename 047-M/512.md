# Can change controller on factory without checking if the factory on controller is set to right factory.

## Summary
Can change controller on factory without checking if the factory on controller is set to right factory.
## Vulnerability Detail
We can change controller on factory by following code
```solidity
    function changeController(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _controller
    ) public onlyTimeLocker controllerIsWhitelisted(_controller) {

        // @audit-issue whitelist check is placed but there is not check that if on controller the factory is set to this one
        if (_controller == address(0)) revert AddressZero();

        address[2] memory vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketId];

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0)) {
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);
        }

        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).changeController(_controller);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).changeController(_controller);

        emit ControllerChanged(_marketId, _controller, vaults[0], vaults[1]);
    }
```
So controller will be set without checking with the controller itself, just checking for whitelist

## Impact
Unexpected reverts and behaviour will occur.
