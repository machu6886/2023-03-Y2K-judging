# Depositor can not rollover 2 different times for the same epoch

## Summary
A user may try to rollover assets from a certain epoch, and after the rollover has been minted, try to rollover more assets, or assets from another epoch.
His second `enlistInRollover` transaction will succeed, but the assets will actually never be rolled over.

## Vulnerability Detail
The rollover queue [saves the last index reached](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L453) while minting rollovers for the next epoch.

If a user asks to change his previous rollover request, his previous entry in the queue [will be edited](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253).

But then, if his first request was already minted,
`rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` will be already further ahead of his request,
and his rollover request will not be minted.

POC:
- Hagbard won epoch 2.
- He enlists to rollover 100 assets from epoch 2 to epoch 3.
- His request is minted by somebody else calling `mintRollovers`.
- He then decides to rollover an additional 100 assets to epoch 3.
- He asks to enlist, and the enlist function updates his previous entry correctly.
- But if the minting function is again called, it will not go over his earlier index again, as `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` is already further ahead, and so Hagbard's assets will not be rolled over.

## Impact
The user assumed that his rollover will be minted, **as the transaction has succeeded**, while actually his funds will just remain sitting idle in the contract.
While the principal can still be delisted and withdrawn, **the user will lose the rewards (collateral/premium) that were to be his had his rollover been minted.**
This is why I believe a medium severity is justified.

## Code Snippet
If a user has already an entry in the queue, upon subsequent enlistings, that entry [will just be updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253):
```solidity
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
```

The rollover minting function [always starts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L372) from the previous index reached:
```solidity
        uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];
```

This creates the problem described above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It looks like the rollover queue needs to be reworked; unfortunately I don't have enough time at the moment to think of the full solution; if I'll have time, I'll try to get back to this.
At the very least, if a user was already rolled over (rollover minted) to the next epoch, his subsequent rollover requests (for the same epoch) should revert, so he will know the assets will not be rolled over.
