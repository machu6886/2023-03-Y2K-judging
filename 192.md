# Rollover mechanism doesn't update the queue index counter after removing item from queue

## Summary
For rollovers, a first-in-first-handled queue is utilized.
Each user gets only one entry in the queue, which is never deleted. His entry is updated upon subsequent rollover requests.
The rollover mechanism saves an index, `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`, which signifies the index upto which the queue has already been handled (minted) for a certain epoch.
This index is not updated upon delisting (which is a removal of somebody from the queue).
**Therefore, after such removal from the queue, the queue index will point to the wrong place, and users will not get their rollovers minted.**

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see in `mintRollovers` that the function [saves](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L453) in `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` the last index not handled for the epoch, and then [starts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L393) from that index upon each subsequent call of the function.
```solidity
        uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];
        ...
        uint256 prevIndex = index;
        ...
        while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            ...
            index++;
        }
        if (executions > 0) rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = index;
```
So it only starts handling from that index.

If a user has delisted himself from a rollover, he will get [removed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L296) from the queue:
```solidity
            rolloverQueue.pop();
```
But the `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]` is not updated. So now it points to the wrong place.

As a POC, consider the following scenario, for epoch number 1:
- Hagbard rolls over his winnings from epoch 0. He enlists in the queue, and then calls `mintRollovers`. The function deposits for him for epoch 1, and [enlists him](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L257) in the queue for the next epoch as well.
- At this point `rolloverAccounting[1]` is 1, as the first element (Hagbard's rollover) has already been handled.
- Hagbard would not like to automatically rollover for epoch 2, so he delists himself from the queue.
- The `delistInRollover` function totally removes him from the queue, but does not update `rolloverAccounting[1]`, which still points to 1.
- Now Malaclypse, another user, also enlists himself in rollover for epoch 1 using his winnings from epoch 0. He trusts that the relayers will execute the `mintRollovers` function.
- However, the `mintRollovers` function will start from index 1, which in this case does not exist. So Malaclypse's item in the queue can not be accessed.
- Malaclypse's rollover can not be minted, leading to the following impact.

## Impact
Rollover mechanism is not fully working, and will lead to users' rollovers requests not being fully respected.
Users might not even be aware of that, as they might rely on keepers to execute the minting, and even if not, they would have to investigate the minting transaction (which wouldn't necessary revert) to find out whether their rollover has been executed.

While the users principal is not lost, still it means that users that asked to be rollovered will just have their funds sitting idly on the contract, losing on the premium or collateral they should have collected.
So as users assets (rewards - collateral/premium) will be lost, and this breaks a core functionality of the code, I believe a medium severity is appropriate.

## Code Snippet
We can see that the minting function only starts from `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`:
```solidity
        uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];
        ...
        uint256 prevIndex = index;
        ...
        while ((index - prevIndex) < (_operations)) {
            ...
            index++;
        }
        if (executions > 0) rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = index;
```
And that this index is not updated when removing an item from the queue.
```solidity
    function delistInRollover(address _owner) public {
        // check if user has already queued up a rollover
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner] == 0) revert NoRolloverQueued();
        // check if sender is approved by owner
        if (
            msg.sender != _owner &&
            isApprovedForAll(_owner, msg.sender) == false
        ) revert OwnerDidNotAuthorize(msg.sender, _owner);

        // swich the last item in the queue with the item to be removed
        uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_owner);
        uint256 length = rolloverQueue.length;
        if (index == length - 1) {
            // if only one item in queue
            rolloverQueue.pop();
            delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
        } else {
            // overwrite the item to be removed with the last item in the queue
            rolloverQueue[index] = rolloverQueue[length - 1];
            // remove the last item in the queue
            rolloverQueue.pop();
            // update the index of prev last user ( mapping index is allways array index + 1)
            ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[rolloverQueue[index].receiver] =
                index +
                1;
            // remove receiver from index mapping
            delete ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_owner];
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
I am not sure, and I'm afraid I don't have enough time to describe the full solution. Basically on the surface we need to save the amount of items that have been removed and take that into account when minting rollovers, including for other epochs as well. If I'll have more time, I'll try to add the full solution.
