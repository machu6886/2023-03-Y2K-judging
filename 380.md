# `mintRollovers` should remove rollovers after successful execution

## Summary

`mintRollovers` should remove rollovers after successful execution

## Vulnerability Detail

After a successful rollover, the `mintRollovers` just replaces the `assets` and `epochId` of a user with new values. 

```solidity
                    rolloverQueue[index].assets = assetsToMint;
                    rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
                    // only pay relayer for successful mints
                    executions++;
```

The issue is that after a successful rollover that a user had enrolled for has succeeded, they remain in the queue with new values and their old index.

Let's say they want to enroll some more assets. Since they still exist in the `rolloverQueue`, their index in the queue will remain the same:

```solidity
        // check if user has already queued up a rollover
        if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
```

Now going back to the `mintRollovers` function, their index has already been recorded as successful:

```solidity
if (executions > 0) rolloverAccounting[_epochId] = index;
```

This means, that when the starting index of the `mintRollovers` function will be a value higher than the user's position in the queue and no rollover will happen for their additional assets.

```solidity
uint256 index = rolloverAccounting[_epochId];
```

## Impact

Users who enlist for rollover of additional assets will not have it executed.

## Recommendation

Remove a user from the `rolloverQueue` after a successful rollover so that when they enlist again, they are pushed to the end of the queue.
