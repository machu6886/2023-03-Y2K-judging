# The `triggerDepeg()` function can make the `claimTVL` less than the `finalTVL` in premium vault

## Summary
Users who hedge with the premium vault will lose the benefit when call the `triggerDepeg()` function success if the `finalTVL` in the colleteral vault is less than the `finalTVL` in the premium vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `triggerDepeg()` function in the `ControllerPeggedAssetV2` contract is used to resolve the epoch and swap the assets between premium and collateral vault.

Normally, the swapping will pay the benefits to the premium vault due to the `claimTVL` state in the premium vault, which is set in line 106, will be greater than the `finalTVL` when the collateral vault has the asset more than the premium vault.

However, the `claimTVL` state in the premium vault, which is set in line 106, can be less than the `finalTVL` when the collateral vault holds less of the asset than the premium vault.

This results in the swapping taking the principal from the premium vault instead.

## Impact
Users will lose instead of benefiting from the hedge in the premium vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to validate the `totalAssets` of each vault to avoid losing principal in the premium vault. If the collateral vault's `totalAssets` are less than or equal to the premium vault, the user cannot deposit into the premium vault, for example:

```solidity
function deposit(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _assets,
        address _receiver
)
    public
    virtual
    override(SemiFungibleVault)
    epochIdExists(_id)
    epochHasNotStarted(_id)
    nonReentrant
{
    if(keccak256(abi.encodePacked((name))) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(("PREMIUM")))){
        if(totalAssets(_id) + _assets >= IVaultV2(counterPartyVault).totalAssets(_id)) 
          revert PremiumGreaterThanVault();
    }
    if (_receiver == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
    SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        _assets
    );

    _mint(_receiver, _id, _assets, EMPTY);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
}

```
