# Amount of emissionTokens are stucked in the vault due to rounding calculation

## Summary
Using round-down to calculate amount of distributing emissionTokens make some emissionTokens stuck in the contract
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Implementation. of function `Carousel.previewEmissionWithdraw()` is as follows: 
```solidity=
function previewEmissionsWithdraw(uint256 _id, uint256 _assets)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256 entitledAmount)
{
    entitledAmount = _assets.mulDivDown(emissions[_id], finalTVL[_id]);
}
```
It was used in function `Carousel.withdraw()` to calculate the emissions to withdraw. Assume that `_assets * emissions[_id]` isn't divisible by `finalTVL`, an amount of emissionTokens won't be transfered to users. 
For instance, 
* `_asset = 9`, `emissions[_id] = 15`, `finalTVL = 10`
--> `entitleAmount = 9 * 15 / 10 = 13.5 > 13`

The amount of emissionTokens is freezed in vault contract can reach to nearly`finalTVL` for each epoch. 
Note that this issue also happens for function `VaultV2.previewWithdraw()`.

## Impact
Amount of emissionTokens are freezed in the vault contracts.

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
Create a new function to let the owner withdraw the remaining amount of emissionToken out of vault
