# Non ERC1155 compliance

## Summary

The README explicitly states that the code is meant to be ERC1155 compliant. Yet the carousel breaks that compliance by restricting `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` is not implemented and will always revert:

```js
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address, /*from*/
    address, /*to*/
    uint256[] memory, /*ids*/
    uint256[] memory, /*amounts*/
    bytes memory /*data*/
) public pure override {
    revert();
}
```

This can break compatibility with other protocols that rely on the safeBatchTransferFrom function being available.

## Impact

Breaking composability and compatibility with other protocols.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. If there are any issues arising from it, mitigate them in ways that dont break the EIP1155 standard.
