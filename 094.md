# Consider a two-step approach when changeOwner in TimeLock

## Summary
Consider a two-step approach when changeOwner in TimeLock

## Vulnerability Detail
When privileged roles are being changed, it is recommended to follow a two-step approach: 
1. The current privileged role proposes a new address for the change
2. The newly proposed address then claims the privileged role in a separate transaction. 

This two-step change allows accidental wrong proposals to be corrected instead of leaving the system operationally with no owner.

## Impact
In [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L171) if `_newOwner` is passed an invalid address accidentally then the owner can never be changed.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider use a two-step approach, in following code
1. Current owner calls `proposeNewOwner`
2. New owner calls `changeOwner` to make proposed owner as real owner

```solidity
contract TimeLock {
    address public policy;
    address public newPolicy;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        if (msg.sender != policy) revert NotOwner(msg.sender);
        _;
    }

   modifier onlyNewOwner() {
        if (msg.sender != newPolicy) revert NotNewOwner(msg.sender);
        _;
    }

   function proposeNewOwner(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        if (_newOwner == address(0)) {
            revert AddressZero();
        }
        newPolicy = _newOwner;
        emit ProposeNewOwner(_newOwner);
    }

   function changeOwner() external onlyNewOwner {
        policy = newPolicy;
        newPolicy = address(0);
        emit ChangeOwner(policy);
    }
}
```
