# Wrong calculate fee formula used.

## Summary
The formula used to calculate the fee percentage is wrong. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The idea behind the formula used to calculate the fee percentage is for the fee to increase linearly as time goes by as people who deposit later have informational advantage (as we understand from the comments in the code). However, the formula works in the other way and as time passes by the fee percentages becomes lower and lower.

## Impact
The formula doesn't work as intended. Since the fee is the highest at the start and the lowest at the end, users have no incentive to deposit early. Everyone will just wait to deposit at the very end so they can make use of both informational advantage and low fees.
