# Users will be unable to deposit their assets which can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

## Summary
The deposit function in the `VaultV2` contract is vulnerable to a DoS attack with block gas limit, the function allows users to deposit assets into the vault, but it does not impose a limit on the maximum amount of assets that can be deposited at once and this can lead to a situation where a user tries to deposit a large amount of assets, and the function fails to execute due to running out of gas. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The deposit function accepts an `_assets` parameter that represents how many assets the user wants to deposit, there is no limit imposed on the maximum amount of assets that can be deposited at once, therefore, if a user tries to deposit a large amount of assets, the function may run out of gas and fail, making it impossible for the user to deposit their assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, you need to add a limit on the maximum amount of assets that can be deposited at once.

Here's the modified code:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT = 10000;

function deposit(
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _assets,
    address _receiver
)
    public
    virtual
    override(SemiFungibleVault)
    epochIdExists(_id)
    epochHasNotStarted(_id)
    nonReentrant
{
+   if (_assets > MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT) revert ExceedsMaxDepositAmount();
    if (_receiver == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
    SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        _assets
    );

    _mint(_receiver, _id, _assets, EMPTY);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, _id, _assets);
}
```
I add a constant variable `MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` that represents the maximum amount of assets that can be deposited at once. I then check if the `_assets` parameter exceeds this limit, and if it does, it revert the transaction.
