# Inadequate total value locked (TVL) check in sendTokens function.

## Summary
The "sendTokens" function checks if the transfer amount is not greater than the total value locked (TVL) in the epoch, however, this check is not sufficient since the `totalAssets` function may return a different value than `finalTVL[_id]` due to the state changes in the epoch after it has been resolved.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract checks if the transfer amount is not greater than the total value locked (TVL) in the epoch. However, this check is not sufficient since the `totalAssets` function may return a different value than `finalTVL[_id]` due to the state changes in the epoch after it has been resolved.

The following line of code from the `sendTokens` function is where the vulnerability exists:
```solidity
if (_amount > finalTVL[_id]) revert AmountExceedsTVL();
```
This check only looks at the `finalTVL` value stored in the `finalTVL` mapping, which is set in the `resolveEpoch` function:
```solidity
finalTVL[_id] = totalAssets(_id);
```
The `totalAssets` function calculates the total value locked in the epoch, and this value can change over time due to state changes in the epoch. Therefore, the `finalTVL` value may not accurately reflect the actual TVL of the epoch when the `sendTokens` function is called.

To illustrate this, suppose the following sequence of events occurs:
```solidity
     +----------+        +----------+          +----------+
     |  Epoch   |        |  Assets  |          |  Epoch   |

          | TVL=100          | TVL=150             | finalTVL=150
          |                  |                     |

     |        |         |          |          |          |

```
The diagram shows three boxes for three different states of the epoch: created, assets added, and resolved. Each epoch has a corresponding TVL (total value locked) that starts at 100 and increases to 150 when assets are added, and then remains at 150 after resolution.

The bottom row shows the caller's account, the contract's TVL, and the epoch's TVL at the time of the `sendTokens` function call. In this scenario, the caller sends 175 tokens, which exceeds the current epoch TVL of 150. However, since the epoch was previously resolved with a finalTVL of 150, the `sendTokens` function does not revert.

## Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal funds from the protocol by sending tokens greater than the total value locked in the epoch.

The vulnerability can also lead to a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by reverting valid transfers due to a difference in the state of the epoch between the TVL check and the actual transfer.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `sendTokens` function should calculate the actual TVL of the epoch at the time the function is called, instead of relying on the finalTVL value.

One way to do this is to call the `totalAssets` function again in the `sendTokens` function:
```solidity
    function sendTokens(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _receiver
    ) external onlyController epochIdExists(_id) epochHasEnded(_id) {
    +   uint256 actualTVL = totalAssets(_id);
        if (_amount > finalTVL[_id]) revert AmountExceedsTVL();
        if (epochAccounting[_id] + _amount > finalTVL[_id])
            revert AmountExceedsTVL();
        if (!whitelistedAddresses[_receiver] && _receiver != counterPartyVault)
            revert DestinationNotAuthorized(_receiver);
        epochAccounting[_id] += _amount;
        SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
    }
```
