# Users depositing in current epoch are forced to deposit more than relayer fee amount

## Summary
Users unable to deposit with amount less than relayerfee despite being in deposit window.
## Vulnerability Detail

There is `minRequiredDeposit` modifier in the deposit and depositEth function of the Carousel contract

Which tries to ensure that the requested deposit amount is greater than the relayerFee. That is justified only for the users trying to deposit outside of the deposit window. 

But users trying to deposit in the current epoch should be able to deposit any amount, even an amount less than relayerFee.

Manual Review
## Recommendation 
- Implement a check which ensures that the above check is only applied for users with `epoch Id 0` inside minRequiredDeposit() modifier.
