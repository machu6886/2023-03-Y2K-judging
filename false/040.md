# _withdrawalFee Not Restricted Can Lead to Overflow and Excessive Fees

## Summary
_withdrawalFee Not Restricted Can Lead to Overflow and Excessive Fees
## Vulnerability Detail
In `VaultFactoryV2::createEpoch`, there is limited restriction on `_withdrawalFee`:
```solidity
function createEpoch(
        uint256 _marketId,
        uint40 _epochBegin,
        uint40 _epochEnd,
        uint16 _withdrawalFee
    ) public onlyOwner returns (uint256 epochId, address[2] memory vaults) {
        vaults = marketIdToVaults[_marketId];

        if (vaults[0] == address(0) || vaults[1] == address(0)) {
            revert MarketDoesNotExist(_marketId);
        }

        if (_withdrawalFee == 0) revert FeeCannotBe0();
```
In other words, `_withdrawalFee` is allowed to be greater than or equal to `10000`.

Let's take a look at `ControllerPeggedAssetV2::triggerEndEpoch()`:
```solidity

.............
uint256 epochFee = vaultFactory.getEpochFee(_epochId);

uint256 premiumTVL = premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId);
uint256 collateralTVL = collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId);

uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);

uint256 premiumTVLAfterFee = premiumTVL - premiumFee;
uint256 collateralTVLAfterFee = collateralTVL + premiumTVLAfterFee;

premiumVault.sendTokens(_epochId, premiumFee, treasury);
premiumVault.sendTokens(
      _epochId,
      premiumTVLAfterFee,
      address(collateralVault)
  );

..............
```
Here, `epochFee` is set to the `_withdrawalFee` corresponding to `_epochId`. Let's assume that `_withdrawalFee` is 10000 at this point, so `epochFee` is also 10000. When `calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee)` is called, `premiumFee` will equal `premiumTVL`. 

Here is the code for `calculateWithdrawalFeeValue()`:
```solidity
function calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(uint256 amount, uint256 fee)
        public
        pure
        returns (uint256 feeValue)
    {
        return amount.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
    }
```

After this, all funds are sent as a fee to the treasury address and `premiumFee` will be equal to 0.

This leads to several issues:

1. If `withdrawalFee` is greater than 10000, it can cause an overflow when subtracting `premiumFee` from `premiumTVL.`
2. If `premiumTVLAfterFee` is equal to 0 and the `asset` does not support 0 transfers, it will revert.

## Recommendation
```diff
if (_withdrawalFee == 0) revert FeeCannotBe0();
+ if (_withdrawalFee >= 10000) revert FeeCannotBe10000();
