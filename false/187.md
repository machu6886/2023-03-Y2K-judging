# Low level call in TimeLock contract

## Summary

A Low level call in TimeLock contract is executed without a prior check on the address of the external contract and using bytes.

## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker able to supply a custom address could and bytes, or only the address can impersonate the default contract to act like a proxy and execute any malicious activity. An attacker need to recreates bytes of function header like method(param1) easy to do with js modules

The issue is in the entire function, but the major important action is performed at line 113

## Impact

An attacker able to supply custom address and interact with the contract can steal funds

## Recommendation

Create a whitelist of allowed contracts, avoid to use low level calls
