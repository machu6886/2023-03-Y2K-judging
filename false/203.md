# Null epoch may cause fund gets locked in vault forever

## Summary

Null epoch could be triggered as a normal ended epoch and may cause fund gets locked in vault forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider an epoch that should be triggered as a null epoch. If no one calls `triggerNullEpoch()` in `v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol` before the epoch ends, `triggerEndEpoch()` could be called instead. If premium vault of that market has deposit while collateral is zero, the premium will be transferred to collateral vault but no one would be able to withdraw the premium since `collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0`. The premiums will be locked into collateral vault forever. Moreover, it's not fair for users who pay premium while there's no collateral in counterparty vault.

## Impact

1. Premium may be locked in collateral vault forever.
2. Market may works not as designed and lack of fairness.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// check if epoch qualifies for null epoch
if (
    premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0 ||
    collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0
) {
    revert VaultZeroTVL();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add check if zero TVL in `function triggerEndEpoch(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _epochId)` just like how `function triggerDepeg(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _epochId)` is done in [L80-L86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L80-L86).
