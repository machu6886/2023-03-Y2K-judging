# Improper Premium / Collateral TVL ratio may cause depositors to lose funds or suffer high risk with low return

## Summary
If Premium TVL is larger than Collateral, Premium depositors lose their funds without sufficient compensation when depegged;
If Premium TVL is MUCH smaller than Collateral, Collateral depositors will take high risk but low return.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the deposit period of each epoch, user can choose to deposit funds in Premium Vault to 'purchase' insurance on a de-peg event, or deposit funds in Collateral Vault to to earn insurance premiums.

If a de-peg event happens, Premium depositors will pay premium and get compensation from Collateral Vault, if vault does not depeg, Collateral depositors will get premium without losing collateral.

The problem is, depositors are unlikely to know what the final Premium / Collateral TVL is at the time of depositing, and they are not allowed to withdraw until epoch ends or price depegged.

Let's assume:
1. Epoch starts and Premium TVL is larger than Collateral TVL (non-zero), in this senario, as premium depositors will pay premium whether or not a depeg happens, it basically means they will lose funds for sure. See below test codes:
```solidity
    function testVeryFewCollateral() public {
        address Alice = address(0x1);
        deal(UNDERLYING, Alice, 10 ether);

        address Bob = address(0x2);
        deal(UNDERLYING, Bob, 1);

        // Alice deposits 10 ether in Premium Valut
        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(premium, 10 ether);
        VaultV2(premium).deposit(epochId, 10 ether, Alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Bob deposits 1 wei in Collater Valut
        vm.startPrank(Bob);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(collateral, 1 ether);
        VaultV2(collateral).deposit(epochId, 1, Bob);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Epoch starts with Premium TVL is larger than Collateral TVL
        vm.warp(begin);
        // Trigger when depegged
        controller.triggerDepeg(marketId, epochId);

        uint256 assets = VaultV2(premium).balanceOf(Alice, epochId);
        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        VaultV2(premium).withdraw(epochId, assets, Alice, Alice);

        // Alice paied premium but gets very few compensation: 1 wei
        uint256 aliceTokenBalance = MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(Alice);
        assertEq(aliceTokenBalance, 1);
    }
```

2. Epoch starts and Premium TVL(non-zero) is MUCH smaller than Collateral TVL, as Collateral depositors will lose their collateral when price depegged, the expected return (premium) is not worth the risk they take. See below test codes:
```solidity
    function testVeryFewPremium() public {
        address Alice = address(0x1);
        deal(UNDERLYING, Alice, 1);

        address Bob = address(0x2);
        deal(UNDERLYING, Bob, 10 ether);

        // Alice deposits 1 wei in Premium Valut
        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(premium, 1);
        VaultV2(premium).deposit(epochId, 1, Alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Bob deposits 10 ether in Collater Valut
        vm.startPrank(Bob);
        MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(collateral, 10 ether);
        VaultV2(collateral).deposit(epochId, 10 ether, Bob);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Epoch starts with Premium TVL is MUCH less than Collateral TVL (1 : 10000000000000000000)
        vm.warp(begin);
        // Trigger when depegged
        controller.triggerDepeg(marketId, epochId);

        uint256 assets = VaultV2(collateral).balanceOf(Bob, epochId);
        vm.startPrank(Bob);
        VaultV2(collateral).withdraw(epochId, assets, Bob, Bob);

        // Bob lost collateral but gets very few premium (1 wei)
        uint256 bobTokenBalance = MintableToken(UNDERLYING).balanceOf(Bob);
        assertEq(bobTokenBalance, 1);
    }
```

## Impact
Depositors will lose funds or suffer high risk with low return

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Please consider allowing user to withdraw after Epoch starts and Premium TVL is larger than Collateral TVL;
2. please consider setting a rational Collateral ratio and allowing user to withdraw after Epoch starts if the acutal ratio is lower.
