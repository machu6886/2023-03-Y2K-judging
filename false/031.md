# Withdraw fee is miscalulated

## Summary

The withdrawal fee is not calculated correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to documentation, a withdrawal fee is stored in the following format:

```solidity
@param _withdrawalFee uint16 of the fee value, multiply your % value by 10, Example: if you want fee of 0.5% , insert 5
```

However, in the `calculateWithdrawalFeeValue` of `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol`, the `feeValue` is calculated as follows:

```solidity
function calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee
) public pure returns (uint256 feeValue) {
    // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
    return amount.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
}
```

A 0.5% fee on an amount of `10_000` should be `50`, but the above calculation returns `5`.

## Impact

This results in a lower withdrawal fee than expected.

## Recommendation

Update the `calculateWithdrawalFeeValue` function to the following:

```diff
function calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee
) public pure returns (uint256 feeValue) {
    // 0.5% = multiply by 10000 then divide by 50
-   return amount.mulDivDown(fee, 10000);
+   return amount.mulDivDown(fee, 1000);
}
```
