# there is no check where the user can pay the relayer fee

## Summary
in _mintDepositQueue when the queue is being executed there is no check on where the user in the while loop has enough funds to pay for the relayer fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
when the deposit queue is executed the _mintshares function is called where shares are minted for each user in the loop, the shares each user gets less what the relayer fee is . there is no check on whether they are able to pay this relayer fee or not
## Impact
the could be an overflow in the number of shares to mint for that user or the whole loop could fail which could lead to a DoS
