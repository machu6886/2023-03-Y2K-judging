# End epoch can be triggered when null epoch

## Summary
The function `triggerEndEpoch` can be called even when an epoch is considered null i.e., either premium or collateral vaults are empty.

## Vulnerability Detail
An epoch is considered null if **either** premium or collateral vaults are empty. Currently, `triggerNullEpoch()` can be called to 1) zero out the `claimTVL` for the empty vault, and 2) set the `claimTVL` to `finalTVL` of the occupied vault. Essentially, this refunds the occupied vault. 

However, it is possible to call `triggerEndEpoch()` when there is a null event. This is problematic because calling `triggerEndEpoch()`, will resolve as a non-depeg event has occurred. In other words, premium will be paid to collateral (fee will be assessed too). In this particular case, if the collateral vault is empty, the premium vault will lose all their deposits. 

## Impact
This is high impact because an adversary can front-run `triggerNullEpoch()` and call `triggerEndEpoch()` instead. This will result in lost funds. If there are no deposits into the collateral vault, premiums will be lost as there will be no one to withdraw. If it is a Carousel, emissions will be lost too.

## Code Snippet
No null epoch check in `triggerEndEpoch()`

Here is a test for it. Add to ControllerPeggedAssetV2Test.t.sol:
```solidity
contract ControllerPeggedAssetV2Test is Helper, ERC1155Holder {
      function testTriggerEndEpochWhenNull() public {
              vm.startPrank(address(this));
              MintableToken(UNDERLYING).approve(premium, 2);
              VaultV2(premium).deposit(epochId, 2, address(this));
              vm.stopPrank();
      
              // Prem has 2 assets, and collateral has 0
              assertEq(VaultV2(premium).totalAssets(epochId), 2);
              assertEq(VaultV2(collateral).totalAssets(epochId), 0);
              assertEq(VaultV2(premium).claimTVL(epochId), 0);
              assertEq(VaultV2(collateral).claimTVL(epochId), 0);
              vm.warp(end + 1);
              controller.triggerEndEpoch(marketId, epochId);

              // Claimable for collateral vault has increased
              assertEq(VaultV2(premium).claimTVL(epochId), 0);
              assertEq(VaultV2(collateral).claimTVL(epochId), 2);
      }
}
```

## Recommendation
- Consider adding a null epoch check similar to [triggerDepeg](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Controllers/ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol#L80-L86)
