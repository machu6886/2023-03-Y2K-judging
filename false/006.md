# MarketAlreadyExists check condition can get passing and this will cause to create duplicate market for one token at VaultFactoryV2.sol#L76

## Summary
at VaultFactoryV2.sol#L76, there is if block to get marketID and check that market is already exists or no based on marketID, if block check condition maybe will fail and this will cause to create duplicate market for one token.

## Vulnerability Detail
as you see, at VaultFactoryV2.sol#L76, we compute marketID by getMarketId(_marketCalldata.token, _marketCalldata.strike). token and strike are two inputs from owner. we use this two inputs in the VaultFactoryV2.sol#L380 to compute market id.

>     function getMarketId(address token, uint256 strikePrice)
>         public
>         pure
>         returns (uint256 marketId)
>     {
>         return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token, strikePrice)));
>     }

the problem is that if strike get change , marketId will get change ! for first time you will use below details to compute market id and create market :

> address token = 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7 and strikePrice = 1 ;

for second time you will use below details to create new market :

> address token = 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7 and strikePrice = 1.1 ;

for second time, computed market is different than first time so if block check condition at VaultFactoryV2.sol#L76 will get pass and a duplicate market will be rebuilt for a token by mistake.

>         marketId = getMarketId(_marketCalldata.token, _marketCalldata.strike);
>         if (marketIdToVaults[marketId][0] != address(0))
>             revert MarketAlreadyExists();
> 

## Impact
a duplicate market will be rebuilt for a token by mistake.

## Recommendation
create a mapping for tokens and check market is already exist based on this mapping.

> struct market{
>     address token;
>     uint256 marketid;
>     bool marketExist;
> }
> 
> mapping(address => market) marketMapping
