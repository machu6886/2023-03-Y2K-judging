# Lack of a null epoch check on the triggerEndEpoch function could cause a loss of funds

## Summary

The function `triggerEndEpoch()` at the `ControllerPeggedAssetV2.sol` contract lacks a check for a null epoch (collateral or premium vault did not received deposits). This means that even if the epoch should have been marked as null, the `triggerEndEpoch()` function can be executed causing loss of funds in the case where the premium vault received deposits and the collateral vault did not.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the end of an epoch is triggered (no depeg occured), the TVL of the premium vault is sent to the collateral vault (minus fees):

```solidity
uint256 epochFee = vaultFactory.getEpochFee(_epochId);

uint256 premiumTVL = premiumVault.finalTVL(_epochId);
uint256 collateralTVL = collateralVault.finalTVL(_epochId);

uint256 premiumFee = calculateWithdrawalFeeValue(premiumTVL, epochFee);

uint256 premiumTVLAfterFee = premiumTVL - premiumFee;
uint256 collateralTVLAfterFee = collateralTVL + premiumTVLAfterFee;

premiumVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, 0);
        
collateralVault.setClaimTVL(_epochId, collateralTVLAfterFee);

premiumVault.sendTokens(_epochId, premiumFee, treasury);
      
premiumVault.sendTokens(
   _epochId,
   premiumTVLAfterFee,
   address(collateralVault)
 );
```

In the case where the premium vault received deposits but the collateral vault did not, means that all the TVL (minus fees) from the premium vault will be sent to the collateral vault, but since nobody minted on the collateral vault, the tokens will get stucked on the collateral vault contract.

## Impact

The funds cannot be recovered by changing the `controller` and calling `sendTokens`, this is because `sendTokens` can only send a total amount up to `finalTVL[epochId]`, since the collateral vault did not received deposits this value is zero:

```solidity
function sendTokens(
        uint256 _id,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _receiver
    ) external onlyController epochIdExists(_id) epochHasEnded(_id) {
        if (_amount > finalTVL[_id]) revert AmountExceedsTVL();
        if (epochAccounting[_id] + _amount > finalTVL[_id])
            revert AmountExceedsTVL();
        if (!whitelistedAddresses[_receiver] && _receiver != counterPartyVault)
            revert DestinationNotAuthorized(_receiver);
        epochAccounting[_id] += _amount;
        SemiFungibleVault.asset.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);
    }
```

The scenario is very unlikely because `triggerEndEpoch()` can only be executed after `epochEnd`, meanwhile `triggerNullEpoch()` can be executed right after `epochBegin`. However, when the solution for a black swan event takes 3-5 lines of code the risk must be unacceptable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the following to the `triggerEndEpoch()` function:

```solidity
// check if epoch qualifies for null epoch
if (
   premiumVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0 ||
   collateralVault.totalAssets(_epochId) == 0
) {
    revert VaultZeroTVL();
  }
```
