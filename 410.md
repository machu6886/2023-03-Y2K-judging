# Change of treasury whitelists and sets different variables

## Summary

`changeTreasury` whitelist and set variables might not necessary point to the same address.

Chaing 

## Vulnerability Detail

When changing the treasury, it whitelists the parameter address of `_treasury` but sets from instance address of `treasury`:

```solidity
    function changeTreasury(uint256 _marketId, address _treasury)
        public
        onlyTimeLocker
    {
       ...

        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).whiteListAddress(_treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[0]).setTreasury(treasury);
        IVaultV2(vaults[1]).setTreasury(treasury);

        ...
    }
```

These addresses might not necessarily be the same.
Also, probably the old treasury should be removed from the whitelist to prevent accidental abuse of privilleges.

## Impact

When `_treasury` !=  `treasury`, it will be impossible to send tokens to this new  `treasury`, and will have to wait for >3 days of timelock for the fix.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove local  `_treasury` parameter and always use global `treasury`?
