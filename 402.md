# User's request for a second rollover will be ignored if his first request is already minted by mintRollover function

## Summary

The  [Carousel](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol) contract keeps tracks of minted rollovers for each epoch by using a state variable called [rolloverAccounting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L453). And `enlistInRollover` function keeps track of each user's rollover details with state variable called [rolloverQueue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253-L257). If there is an entry that already exists for the user, then the new rollover details will be overwritten into the old `rolloverQueue`. This means that the second request for rollover will be ignored, if the minting is already done on the first request. As, as per  `rolloverAccounting`, that index in `rolloverQueue` is already processed.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. User first opts in for rollover of half of his tokens by calling the `enlistInRollover` function. Since he is calling this function for the first time, a new entry will be [pushed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L260-L265) into the `rolloverQueue` array. 
2. Next, before the epoch starts a relayer will call the `mintRollovers` function. 
3. The user's request  will be processed, if he has won the previous epoch.
4. Once a queue item is processed, the `rolloverAccounting` array is [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L453) with the latest index processed by the `mintRollovers` function. 
5. Next time `mintRollovers` is called, for this specific epochId, the indices less than this saved index will be ignored by this function for minting. This is done [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L372).
6. Now at some point before the epoch actually starts, the user decides to deposit the remaining tokens he has to the upcoming epoch as well. So he calls the  `enlistInRollover` again. This time, since there is an entry already in the name of the user, the `rolloverQueue` array is [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253-L257) without pushing a new element into it.
7. Afterwards, a relayer calls the `mintRollovers` function. But this time, the starting index is past the user's `rolloverQueue` index. So his rollover request gets ignored. 
8. He loses his chance to participate in the epoch and losses his investment opportunity. 

## Impact

Users request for a second rollover will be ignored if his first request is already minted by mintRollover function.

## Code Snippet
The following poc was written, 

```solidity
    function testElku7() public {

        testDepositIntoQueueMultiple();

        // create new epoch
        uint40 _epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 3 days);
        uint40 _epochEnd = uint40(block.timestamp + 4 days);
        uint256 _epochId = 3;
        uint256 _emissions = 100 ether;

        deal(emissionsToken, address(vault), 500 ether, true);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin, _epochEnd, _epochId);
        vault.setEmissions( _epochId, _emissions);

        uint256 prevEpochUserBalance = 10 ether - relayerFee;

        uint256 prevEpoch = 2;
        // enlist in rollover for next epoch
        helperRolloverFromEpoch(prevEpoch, USER,  5 ether - relayerFee);  //vault.enlistInRollover(_epoch, amount, user);
        helperRolloverFromEpoch(prevEpoch, USER2, prevEpochUserBalance);

        // resolve prev epoch
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2 days + 1 hours); // warp to one hour after prev epoch end
        vm.startPrank(controller);
        vault.resolveEpoch(prevEpoch);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // simulate prev epoch win

        console.log("");
        console.log("The balance of USER for  epochId 3 didnt increase by 2 ether even though it was added for rollover");

    }

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode, Foundry

## Recommendation

This needs much deeper changes, as there are many problems with the current logic of the code, as I mentioned in my other submissions.
