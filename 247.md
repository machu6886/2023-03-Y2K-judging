# Wrong assignment to `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` will lead catastrophic impact

## Summary
Carousel contract has a mechanism to support rollover of assets from winning epoch to next epoch. Users enroll/de-enroll from this feature any time. In order to enroll for rollover, users first need to deposit assets in a given epoch and then can call `enlistInRollover` for enrollment. There is logic in place to allow users to update `assets` in enrollment but after updating assets it does update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` too which should not have happened.
## Vulnerability Detail
`enlistInRollover()` allows any user who deposited in a given epoch, to enroll in rolling over assets to the next epoch.

When user call enlist for 1st time, it does record user's data and store `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length` and all works okay but if a user who previously called this function call again for same epoch then code logic does update user's assets but also update index to `rolloverQueue.length` .  `rolloverQueue.length` is not correct index of user if this user is not last in the rolloverQueue and this can leads to catastrophic impacts.  

In order to determine user's position for rollover the only source of truth is value stored in `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` mapping which actually will refer to wrong position if user called `enlistInRollover()` twice in same epoch after some other users has joined `rolloverQueue`.

See below code [snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L253-L268) from `enlistInRollover()` in Carousel.sol
```solidity
	if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
    	// if so, update the queue
    	uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
    	rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
    	rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
	} else {
    	// if not, add to queue
    	rolloverQueue.push(
        	QueueItem({
            	assets: _assets,
            	receiver: _receiver,
            	epochId: _epochId
        	})
    	);
	}
	// This line of code should be part of `else` condition
	ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```

## Impact
There are so many impacts of this vulnerability.
Let's assume 1 scenario:
- Alice calls `enlistInRollover()` with 100 assets
- Bob calls `enlistInRollover` with 10 assets
- Alice again calls `enlistInRollover` with 50 assets.

Due to a wrong update in the index during the 2nd call of Alice, now `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex` will return `1` for both Alice and Bob.  After this update, accounting of Alice's assets is corrupt.  This allows Alice to withdraw/transfer shares because `notRollingOver` modifier can be bypassed.

This is just 1 of the possible scenarios where this vulnerability can lead to critical issues.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider moving `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;` inside `else` condition as it should only be done for new users.
