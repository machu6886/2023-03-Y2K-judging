# DepositFee can be avoided completely

## Summary
By queuing their deposit and immediately calling mintDepositInQueue in the same transaction, the user completely avoids paying the deposit fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L479-L489
If the user wants to deposit immediately (without queuing), they get charged a deposit fee (the calculation of which encourages early deposits).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L334
There is no such calculation in mintDepositInQueue.

Also observe that the depositQueue is last-in-first-out.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L495
The user can simply queue their deposit and call mintDepositInQueue with _operations=1 in the same transaction. They get to immediately deposit without getting charged the deposit fee.

## Impact
Users can avoid deposit fee. This also means that there's no longer an incentive to deposit early.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This would depend on the intended behavior. One solution is to add the deposit fee calculation to mintDepositInQueue as well. However, a downside of this approach is that the amount of deposit fee is now in the control of the relayer instead of the user.
