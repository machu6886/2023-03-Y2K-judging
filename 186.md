# For any epochId, an attacker can prevent many other users' assets from being rolled over

## Summary
An attacker can prevent many other users' assets from being rolled over by increasing rolloverAccounting[epochId] as many times as he wants.

## Vulnerability Detail
mintRollovers(_epochId,_operations) rolls over _assets of users enlisted in the rolloverQueue array to another _epochId.

The function starts from an `index` which will be read from a state mapping `rolloverAccounting[_epochId]`, this index will be incremented by the number of successful rollovers done at the end of the function.

Let's say the rolloverQueue = [], and rolloverAccounting[whateverEpochId]=0, index = 0
An attacker can manually increment this `index` by calling enlistInRollover, mintRollovers and then delistInRollover, and continue the cycle `n` times. After doing that, index=n, rolloverQueue=[].
Then, when the next `n` users enlistInRollover, their _assets won't be rolled over because rolling over will start from index `n`+ (`rolloverQueue.length` before attack).



## Impact
Attacker can prevent many other users' assets from being rolled over

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check in the delistInRollover function to prevent a user from delisting once his assets for an epochId have been rolled over.
