# Deposits via depositETH() function will fail when paying fees

## Summary

Users who use a carousel Vault will either deposit via `deposit(uint256,uint256,address)` or via `depositETH(uint256,address)` which is payable and use `msg.value` to transfer ETH to the vault but these 2 functions redirect to another function `_deposit(uint256,uint256,address)` that, if `_id != 0` and `depositFee >0` (classic usage), will make depositor pays fees. 
Otherwise these fees need to be paid in the vault Asset ERC20 token.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user want to deposit Ethers only via `depositETH(uint256,address)` they will still need to have vault asset in their wallet, which is not the wanted mechanism of the depositETH function

## Impact

Transactions using only ETH will revert as there is no tokens to pay fees

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Either change the implementation of the `_deposit()` function or change the way a user who deposits ETH need to pay fees
