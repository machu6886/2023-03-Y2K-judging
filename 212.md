# LACK OF 2-STEP OWNERSHIP CHANGE FOR CRITICAL ADDRESSES

## Summary
Lack of 2-Step ownership change for the `changeOwner` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `changeOwner` function of the `TimeLock.sol` contract uses single step ownership change. When a wrong address is mistakenly  set as the new owner due to human error, the ownership can not be reversed or rescued since it is a one time setting.
## Impact
One step ownership change could lead to irreversibly setting a wrong and address but 2 step ownership change would allow the new owner to confirm their address to effect the change. This could lead to rendering `onlyOwner` functions inoperable.
## Code Snippet
File: -  [Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/TimeLock.sol#L171)
```Solidity
File: src/v2/TimeLock.sol
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        if (_newOwner == address(0)) {
            revert AddressZero();
        }
        policy = _newOwner;
        emit ChangeOwner(_newOwner);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using 2 step ownership as used in the openzeppelin's 2-step Ownable contract: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol
```Solidity
 /**
     * @dev Starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account. Replaces the pending transfer if there is one.
     * Can only be called by the current owner.
     */
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        _pendingOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferStarted(owner(), newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`) and deletes any pending owner.
     * Internal function without access restriction.
     */
    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual override {
        delete _pendingOwner;
        super._transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev The new owner accepts the ownership transfer.
     */
    function acceptOwnership() public virtual {
        address sender = _msgSender();
        require(pendingOwner() == sender, "Ownable2Step: caller is not the new owner");
        _transferOwnership(sender);
    }
```
