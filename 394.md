# If more than one unresolved epochs exist in the vault then mintRollovers function will revert

## Summary

In the  [mintRollovers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-Y2K/blob/main/Earthquake/src/v2/Carousel/Carousel.sol#L381-L382) function in the `Carousel` contract, there is a condition which checks if the last epoch is resolved. This assumes that the new epoch is set with the Vault contract only after the current epoch is resolved. If the owner has intentionally or accidentally set future epochs, then it will revert the `mintRollovers` function, thus making the contract useless. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. When a new epoch is set, it pushes the epoch information into an array of structures ( called `epochs` ). The new epoch is set using the `setEpoch` function in VaultV2 contract and here, there is no check if the previous epoch is resolved. 
2. If there are multiple future epochs present in the `epochs` array, then they are unresolved. 
3. So when someone calls the `mintRollovers` function, the following check reverts:
```solidity
        // prev epoch is resolved
        if (!epochResolved[epochs[epochs.length - 2]])
            revert EpochNotResolved();
```
4. This breaks the functionality and makes the contract useless from that point onwards. Unfortunately there is no function to `unset` an inactive epoch which hasn't started yet and makes this crippled state of the protocol an immutable state.
 
## Impact

Contract becomes non-functional because `mintRollovers` function will constantly revert. 

## Code Snippet

The  POC is shown below:

```solidity
    function testElku() public {
        // test multiple deposits into queue
        uint40 _epochBegin = uint40(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        uint40 _epochEnd = uint40(block.timestamp + 2 days);
        uint256 _epochId = 2;
        uint256 _emissions = 100 ether;

        deal(emissionsToken, address(vault), 100 ether, true);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin, _epochEnd, _epochId);
        vault.setEmissions( _epochId, _emissions);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin + 7 days, _epochEnd + 8 days, _epochId+1);
        vault.setEpoch(_epochBegin + 10 days, _epochEnd + 11 days, _epochId+2);

        helperDepositInEpochs(_epochId,USER, true);  // vault.deposit(queue ? 0 : _epoch, 10 ether, user);

        vault.mintDepositInQueue(_epochId, 6);

        vm.startPrank(controller);
        vm.warp(_epochBegin + 2 days + 1 hours);
        vault.resolveEpoch(_epochId);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(_epochBegin + 6 days);


        vm.startPrank(USER);
        vault.enlistInRollover(_epochId, 9 ether, USER);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vault.mintRollovers(_epochId+1, 6);

    }
```

Running the above test results in an error as shown below:

```solidity
Running 1 test for test/V2/Carousel/CarouselTest.t.sol:CarouselTest
[FAIL. Reason: EpochNotResolved()] testElku()
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode, Foundry.

## Recommendation

Create a check in the `setEpoch` function in `VaultV2` contract to make sure that the previous epoch is resolved before creating a new one.
